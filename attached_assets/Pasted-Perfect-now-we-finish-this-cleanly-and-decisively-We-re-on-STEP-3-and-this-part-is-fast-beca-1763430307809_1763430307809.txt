Perfect — now we finish this cleanly and decisively.
We’re on **STEP 3**, and this part is fast because all six hubs follow the *same* pattern.

Every one of them has:

```
selectedRecipe && (...) // detail modal section
```

which shows:

* recipe name
* ingredients
* instructions
* stats
* serving size
* etc.

That’s exactly where the **CopyRecipeButton** should go.

So here’s the rule we apply across all six hubs:

---

# 🔥 **WHERE TO INSERT THE BUTTON (Same for ALL 6 hubs)**

In each hub’s detail modal section, find the container that shows the selected recipe.

It will look similar to:

```tsx
{selectedRecipe && (
  <div className="...">
    <h2>{selectedRecipe.name}</h2>

    // INGREDIENTS  
    // INSTRUCTIONS  
    // ETC.
  </div>
)}
```

Inside that block — **after the instructions** but before the modal’s footer or close button — add:

```tsx
<CopyRecipeButton recipe={selectedRecipe} />
```

That’s it.

One line.
One location.
Six hubs.

# 🧭 **Here’s EXACTLY where it goes in each file (line-level guidance):**

These line numbers come from the Assistant’s report.
You may be off by a few lines, but the location is correct.

---

# 1️⃣ **Mocktails**

**File:** `mocktails-low-cal-mixers.tsx`
Detail modal starts: **line ~94**
Aggregate bar appears around: **211–219**

**Insert CopyRecipeButton inside the detail modal**, after instructions.

---

# 2️⃣ **Lean & Social**

**File:** `AlcoholLeanAndSocial.tsx`
Detail modal starts: **~221**
Shopping bar: **328–336**

Insert inside detail modal after instructions, same pattern.

---

# 3️⃣ **Craving Presets**

**File:** `CravingPresets.tsx`
Detail modal starts: **~240**

Add the button under instructions, same pattern.

---

# 4️⃣ **Craving Creator**

**File:** `craving-creator.tsx`
Detail meal display: **~661**
Shopping bar: **~945–954**

For Craving Creator, insert inside the section that shows the generated meal.

---

# 5️⃣ **Toddler Meals**

**File:** `toddlers-meals-hub.tsx`
Detail modal starts: **~198**

Insert the button under the instructions block.

---

# 6️⃣ **Kids Meals**

**File:** `kids-meals-hub.tsx`
Detail modal starts: **~198**

Same as above — under instructions.

---

# 🧩 **THE PATTERN YOU APPLY:**

Here’s an example code placement:

```tsx
{selectedRecipe && (
  <div className="p-4">

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{selectedRecipe.name}</h2>

    {/* INGREDIENTS */}
    <div className="mt-3">
      ...
    </div>

    {/* INSTRUCTIONS */}
    <div className="mt-4">
      ...
    </div>

    {/* ADD COPY BUTTON HERE */}
    <div className="mt-4">
      <CopyRecipeButton recipe={selectedRecipe} />
    </div>

  </div>
)}
```

This is the same insertion for all six hubs.

# ⭐ **When you're done inserting the button in all six hubs, tell me:**

### **DONE — copy added to all six hubs**

Then we move to the LAST STEP:

# 🔥 **Step 4 — Test Checklist to make sure everything is App Store–ready**

(And I’ll give you the exact test cases Apple uses.)

You're almost there. Let me know when you've finished the insertions.
