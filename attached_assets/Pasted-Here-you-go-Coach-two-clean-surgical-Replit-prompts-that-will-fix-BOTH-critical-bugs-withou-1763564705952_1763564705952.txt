Here you go, Coach — **two clean, surgical Replit prompts** that will fix BOTH critical bugs *without touching anything else*.
These are written exactly the way the Replit Architect wants them: precise, scoped, safe.

---

# ✅ **REPLIT PROMPT #1 — Fix Restaurant Guide (404 BUG)**

This fixes the `.js` import bug that is breaking the entire Restaurant Guide feature.

### **Copy + Paste EXACTLY this into Replit:**

```
You are updating ONLY ONE FILE:

📌 FILE TO EDIT:
server/index.ts

🎯 GOAL:
Fix the Restaurant Guide 404 bug by correcting the import path at the top of the file.

❗ IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT modify any other lines.
- Do NOT rename anything.
- Do NOT change any routes.
- Do NOT add new code.
- Only fix the INCORRECT import extension.

🛠️ SPECIFIC REQUIRED CHANGE:
Find this line near the top:

import restaurantRoutes from "./routes/restaurants.js";

Change it to this:

import restaurantRoutes from "./routes/restaurants";

That’s all. Make the edit exactly as written and save the file.
```

# ✅ **REPLIT PROMPT #2 — Fix Craving Creator Endpoint (Frontend/Backend mismatch)**

### **Copy + Paste EXACTLY this into Replit:**

```
You are fixing the Craving Creator endpoint mismatch. You will update TWO files ONLY.

==========================
1️⃣ FILE TO EDIT (FRONTEND):
client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx
==========================

🎯 GOAL:
Make the frontend call the correct API endpoint.

🔧 REQUIRED CHANGE:
Find the fetch() call that currently uses:

/api/meals/craving-creator

and replace it with the correct backend endpoint:

/api/craving-creator/generate

Do NOT change anything else in the file.


==========================
2️⃣ FILE TO EDIT (OPTIONAL SAFEGUARD):
server/routes/craving-creator.ts
==========================

🎯 GOAL:
Verify that the backend route exports a POST handler at:
/api/craving-creator/generate

If the route is correct, DO NOTHING.
If the route name differs, align it so the handler responds at:
/api/craving-creator/generate

💥 NO other edits. No refactors. No renaming. No file moves.
Just ensure endpoint alignment.
```

# 🔥 After These Fixes

We'll verify:

* Restaurant Guide returns a full AI meal with images
* Craving Creator returns meals consistently
* All 5 systems are at least functioning before we unify them

Once confirmed, we start **Phase 1 of the Unified AI Meal Engine**.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A full QA checklist
✅ Post-fix test commands
✅ The Replit prompt for the unified AI endpoint
Just say the word.
