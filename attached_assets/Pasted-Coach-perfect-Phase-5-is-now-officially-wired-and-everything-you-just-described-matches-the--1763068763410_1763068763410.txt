Coach — **perfect.** Phase 5 is now officially wired, and everything you just described matches the plan exactly.

Now here’s what you need next, and it’s *important*:

---

# ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD TELL THE REPLIT ASSISTANT *RIGHT NOW*

You need to confirm to the assistant that Phase 5 is complete **and** tell it what happens next so it doesn’t start “fixing” or touching unrelated parts of the app.

Copy/paste this to the Replit Assistant:

---

### 📩 **MESSAGE FOR REPLIT ASSISTANT — Phase 5 is Complete, STOP & VERIFY BEFORE NEXT STEPS**

Phase 5 implementation is complete.
You successfully:

* Verified both diet config files
* Updated MealIngredientPicker to accept dietConfig + dietType
* Updated LifestyleDietMenuBuilder to load, persist, and pass dietConfig
* Updated ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder the same way
* Ensured fallback to generic ingredients when dietConfig is not provided
* Updated AI generation request with dietType
* Implemented empty-state behavior exactly as specified
* Kept ALL existing boards (Weekly, Diabetic, GLP-1, HardBody, ProCare) untouched

Before we proceed to Phase 6 or any refinements, I need you to:

**1. Re-scan all files you modified**
Confirm:

* No unintended changes
* No conflicts
* No naming mismatches
* No lost imports or unused imports
* DietConfig type consistency
* MealSlot = "snacks" everywhere

**2. Confirm the two new menu builders compile cleanly**

* LifestyleDietMenuBuilder
* ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder

**3. DO NOT introduce new logic, refactors, or styling changes.**
Only verify correctness and stability.

After verification, report back:

* Which files are stable
* Whether MealIngredientPicker receives correct dietConfig props
* Whether AI requests include dietType
* Whether snack card behavior remains untouched
* Whether all boards still use "snacks" consistently

No changes unless I explicitly say so.

# 🧠 COACH — HERE’S WHY THIS IS PERFECT

This message does **three things**:

1. **Stops the assistant** from “helpfully” rewriting something that doesn’t need rewriting
2. **Forces a verification pass** so it double-checks its own work
3. **Protects your existing meal boards** (so nothing gets accidentally broken)

You’re keeping the assistant on a tight leash while still letting it do the grunt work.

---

# 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Only after verification)

Once the assistant confirms everything is clean, Phase 6 is:

### **Phase 6 – Fully Integrate Diet Guardrails Into Meal Generation**

* Add guardrail configuration cards (just like diabetic/GLP1)
* Wire guardrails into AI prompts
* Add preset templates for each diet
* Add validation logic (e.g., Keto macros, AIP restrictions)

But don’t start that until the assistant verifies Phase 5 is spotless.

If you want, I can draft the Phase 6 brief next — just say the word.
