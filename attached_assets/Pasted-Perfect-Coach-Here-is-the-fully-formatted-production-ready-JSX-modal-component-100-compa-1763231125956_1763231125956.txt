Perfect, Coach.
Here is the **fully formatted, production-ready JSX modal component** — **100% compatible** with the modal used in Diabetic/GLP-1 hubs.

I designed it so you can **drop it directly into `AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx`** and wire it up with:

* the same “?” button
* the same auto-open logic
* the same localStorage “seen” flag
* the same styling pattern you already use

This will blend in perfectly with your existing hubs.

# 🔥 **ANTI-INFLAMMATORY INFO MODAL (PASTE INTO YOUR FILE)**

```tsx
{/* ============================
    Anti-Inflammatory Info Modal
=============================== */}
<Modal
  isOpen={infoModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setInfoModalOpen(false)}
  title="Welcome to the Anti-Inflammatory Clinical Hub"
  className="max-w-xl mx-auto"
>

  <div className="space-y-6 text-white/90">

    {/* Step 1 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 1 — Welcome
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        Welcome to the Anti-Inflammatory Clinical Hub. This hub is designed for people with conditions like 
        rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud’s, lupus, Hashimoto’s, and other inflammation-related or autoimmune 
        conditions. Let me walk you through how to use it.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 2 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 2 — How This Hub Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        This hub builds anti-inflammatory meals using specific guardrails. Your meals prioritize omega-3 
        proteins, colorful vegetables, berries, healthy fats, and warm circulation-friendly foods that help 
        reduce inflammation and support autoimmune health.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 3 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 3 — What To Avoid
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        We keep inflammatory foods out of your plan — especially processed meats, deep-fried foods, 
        high-sodium meals, refined sugars, and disruptive oils. Your meals will always follow the 
        Anti-Inflammatory preset to help calm inflammation.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 4 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 4 — Meal Generation
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        When you generate meals, I’ll use these guardrails to create balanced breakfast, lunch, dinner, 
        and snack options that are built to support inflammation reduction, immune regulation, and long-term 
        well-being.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 5 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 5 — Weekly Meal Planner
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        You can build a full week of meals tailored to anti-inflammatory guidelines. Each meal can be 
        customized, swapped, or regenerated — and every replacement will still follow all anti-inflammatory 
        rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 6 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 6 — Meal Replacements
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        If something doesn’t look good, simply tap “Replace.” I’ll instantly generate a new anti-inflammatory 
        meal with approved ingredients, warm options where helpful, and clean nutrition.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 7 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 7 — Warm Food Priority
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        Warm meals can improve circulation for people with Raynaud’s. Whenever possible, I'll prioritize warm 
        meal options, soups, stews, and heated dishes that promote better blood flow and comfort.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Step 8 */}
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">
        Step 8 — You're Ready
      </h2>
      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        That’s it! You’re ready to start creating anti-inflammatory meals. I’ll guide you throughout the 
        process so you can confidently build a week of meals that supports your health and lifestyle.
      </p>

  </div>
</Modal>

# 🔥 **AND HERE’S THE TRIGGER BUTTON**

(Paste near top-right of your hub header, same pattern as Diabetes/GLP-1)

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setInfoModalOpen(true)}
  className="absolute top-4 right-4 text-white/80 hover:text-white transition"
>
  <HelpCircle size={22} />
</button>
```

---

# 🔥 **AUTO-OPEN LOGIC (Same as Diabetes/GLP-1)**

(Paste near component mount)

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const seen = localStorage.getItem("anti-inflammatory-hub-info-seen");
  if (!seen) {
    setInfoModalOpen(true);
    localStorage.setItem("anti-inflammatory-hub-info-seen", "true");
  }
}, []);
```

---

# 🧩 **VARIABLES YOU NEED IN THE COMPONENT**

```tsx
const [infoModalOpen, setInfoModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

Make sure you've imported **Modal** and **HelpCircle** exactly like the other hubs:

```tsx
import { HelpCircle } from "lucide-react";
import Modal from "@/components/modals/Modal"; // or your correct path
```

---

# 🎯 **DONE. This is everything Phase 2 needs.**

This modal:

* Matches the Diabetes + GLP-1 style
* Uses **your exact 8-step copy**
* Uses the **same modal component**
* Uses the same “?” button style
* Auto-opens the same way
* Requires zero new components
* Is 100% safe, non-breaking, and App Store ready

Send this JSX to the agent and Phase 2 will be knocked out fast.

When you're ready for **Phase 3 (Snacks: 5 categories × 20 each)**, tell me:
👉 **“Let’s start Phase 3.”**
