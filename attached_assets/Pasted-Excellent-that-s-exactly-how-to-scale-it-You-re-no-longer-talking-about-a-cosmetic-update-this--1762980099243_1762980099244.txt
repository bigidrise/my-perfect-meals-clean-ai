Excellent — that’s exactly how to scale it. You’re no longer talking about a cosmetic update — this is a **content-level and visual data expansion** for the AI snack picker system.

Here’s the updated **Replit Assistant implementation brief** with all your points built in:

## 🧠 Replit Assistant Brief — Snack Ingredient Expansion + DALL·E Image Generation

### 🎯 Objective

Expand and enhance the **snack ingredient picker** dataset (`client/src/data/snackIngredients.ts`) used by the **AI Snack Generator** across all boards.

Each of the six snack categories must now include **15–20 ingredient options** and automatically generate corresponding **AI-based snack images** through the **DALL·E system**, matching how existing meal cards get their visuals.

---

### 📂 Files to Modify

* `client/src/data/snackIngredients.ts` – expand dataset
* `client/src/services/mealEngineService.ts` – confirm DALL·E image generation hook is called for snacks (use existing meal image workflow)
* `client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` – ensure snack picker loads and renders full expanded list with category chips

### 🧠 Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Data Structure:**
   Each ingredient entry should follow the existing pattern in other categories:

   ```ts
   { name: string; image?: string }
   ```

   The `image` field should be populated using the DALL·E image generator (same function used for main meals).

2. **DALL·E Integration:**

   * Call the same image generator service used by `mealEngineService` when a new snack ingredient list is seeded.
   * Generate one image per ingredient with prompts like:

     ```
     “Healthy [ingredient name] snack on white plate, high-quality photo style, minimal background”
     ```
   * Cache or persist those images using the same CDN path or local fallback as other meal visuals.

3. **Front-End Picker Behavior:**

   * Each category chip (Sweet, Savory, Light, Protein, Drinkables, Dessert) must display **15–20 ingredients**.
   * Clicking a chip autofills 3–5 random ingredients into the AI prompt builder.
   * Scrolling or expanding lists should be supported if >10 items.
   * The image thumbnails must appear next to ingredient names just like on the regular meal picker.

4. **Consistency Across Boards:**

   * All snack cards (Weekly, Diabetic, GLP-1, Hard Body, Pro Care) use this updated picker dataset automatically.
   * Do not alter any Snack Card layouts, buttons, or logic.

5. **Testing Checklist:**

   * Each snack picker category displays 15–20 ingredients with images.
   * Snack generation AI prompt includes selected ingredients.
   * DALL·E images appear consistently next to ingredient names.
   * “Create Snack with AI” returns snack-appropriate recipes.
   * Works identically on all boards; no performance lag or console errors.

Would you like me to include a **seed snippet** (example JSON or JS array) showing how each category’s data should be structured for the Replit assistant to follow exactly?
