🔥 **Perfect, Coach — Phase 1 is DONE.**
You’ve got the Anti-Inflammatory Clinical Hub built on the correct foundation (Diabetic Menu Builder).
Now we move into **Phase 2: Co-Pilot Integration** — and this is where the hub becomes *smart*, *guided*, and App-Of-The-Year ready.

I’m going to give you EXACTLY what the agent/architect needs:

* The Co-Pilot system requirements
* The script
* The architectural integration points
* The exact lines to add
* The instructions to guarantee no one breaks the hub

Use this in your Phase 2 directive — it’s “plug and play.”

# 🚀 **PHASE 2 — CO-PILOT INTEGRATION (Anti-Inflammatory Hub)**

This is the **Co-Pilot Navigation System** that every clinical hub must have.

## 🎯 **What Phase 2 Includes**

1. Add a Co-Pilot trigger button (same as Weekly Meal Builder)
2. Add a dedicated Co-Pilot script for Anti-Inflammatory
3. Add step-by-step walkthrough steps
4. Ensure it uses the **same animations / UI / UX** across all hubs
5. Hook it into the Anti-Inflammatory Hub ONLY
6. Maintain strict visual uniformity
7. NO affecting Diabetes or GLP-1 hubs
8. NO building new co-pilot components — reuse the existing framework

### 📌 **PHASE 2 — ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CO-PILOT INTEGRATION**

Now that the Anti-Inflammatory Menu Builder Hub is built on the correct foundation, we are adding the **Co-Pilot Walkthrough**.

### 🔥 REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Use the existing Co-Pilot system already used in the Weekly Meal Builder.**

   * Same component
   * Same animation
   * Same floating button
   * Same overlay style
   * Same speech bubble layout
   * Same timing

2. **Add a new Co-Pilot script dedicated to the Anti-Inflammatory hub.**

   * DO NOT reuse Diabetes or GLP-1 scripts
   * DO NOT create generic text
   * Use the exact script provided below

3. **Add the Co-Pilot trigger button inside the Anti-Inflammatory Hub**

   * Same position as the Weekly Meal Builder’s Co-Pilot
   * Usually top-right floating icon (but follow exact existing pattern)

4. **The Co-Pilot must walk the user through:**

   * What this hub is for
   * How the guardrails work
   * How to generate meals
   * How to replace meals
   * How to use the weekly planner
   * Tips specific to Anti-Inflammatory diets

5. **Zero changes to Diabetes / GLP-1 hubs**

6. **Zero styling inconsistencies**

# 🟣 **ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CO-PILOT SCRIPT (USE EXACT TEXT)**

This is the script you paste into the Co-Pilot system as the guided steps.

---

### **STEP 1 — Welcome**

“Welcome to the Anti-Inflammatory Clinical Hub. This hub is designed for people with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud’s, lupus, Hashimoto’s, and other inflammation-related or autoimmune conditions. Let me walk you through how to use it.”

---

### **STEP 2 — How This Hub Works**

“This hub builds anti-inflammatory meals using specific guardrails. Your meals prioritize omega-3 proteins, colorful vegetables, berries, healthy fats, and warm circulation-friendly foods.”

---

### **STEP 3 — What to Avoid**

“We keep inflammatory foods out of your plan: processed meats, deep-fried foods, high-sodium meals, refined sugars, and disruptive oils. Your meals will always follow the Anti-Inflammatory preset.”

---

### **STEP 4 — Meal Generation**

“When you generate meals, I’ll use these guardrails to create balanced breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options that support inflammation reduction and autoimmune health.”

---

### **STEP 5 — Weekly Meal Planner**

“You can build a full week of meals. Each meal can be customized, replaced, or regenerated, all while staying inside the anti-inflammatory rules.”

---

### **STEP 6 — Meal Replacements**

“If you don’t like a meal, tap ‘Replace’ and I’ll generate a new anti-inflammatory meal instantly."

---

### **STEP 7 — Warm Foods Reminder**

“For Raynaud’s and circulation issues, warm foods can help. Whenever available, I’ll prioritize warm meal options for you.”

---

### **STEP 8 — You're Ready**

“That’s it! You’re all set. Start generating your Anti-Inflammatory meals, and I’ll guide you every step of the way.”

# 🧱 **INTEGRATION NOTES FOR THE ARCHITECT**

**COPY THIS TOO:**

---

### 📐 Technical Integration Notes

1. **Co-Pilot component location**
   Use the same Co-Pilot component used in Weekly Meal Builder:

   * Likely in `client/src/components/Copilot/` or similar

2. **Add a new script entry**
   Example:

```ts
copilotScripts["antiInflammatory"] = AntiInflammatoryCopilotScript;
```

3. **Attach Co-Pilot to Hub**
   Inside `AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx`:

```tsx
<CopilotTrigger scriptId="antiInflammatory" />
```

4. **Ensure no global state is overwritten**
   Copilot scripts must be scoped.

5. **Styling**

   * Same FAB button
   * Same icon
   * Same glow
   * Same container animations

6. **Testing Requirements**

   * Co-Pilot opens
   * All steps progress
   * Does not appear in other hubs
   * Does not break Weekly Meal Builder
   * Does not modify Diabetes or GLP-1 Co-Pilots

---

# 🎯 **PHASE 2 DELIVERABLES**

At the end of Phase 2, the architect/agent must deliver:

✔ Anti-Inflammatory Co-Pilot integrated
✔ Script implemented
✔ Floating Co-Pilot button visible
✔ All steps working
✔ No regressions in Diabetes or GLP-1 hubs
✔ No console errors
✔ No styling inconsistencies
✔ No meal logic broken

---

# 🔥 READY FOR PHASE 2 EXECUTION

Just tell me if you want:

➡ The full Phase 3 spec (Snacks System + Categories + 100 Items)
➡ The RA/Raynaud's-friendly snack list
➡ The expanded meal templates
➡ Or all next phases lined up in order

You're in perfect shape.
