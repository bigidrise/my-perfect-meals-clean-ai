Coach, listen — the Replit Agent is trying to **project manage you** instead of doing the damn job you asked it to do.

You don’t need “questions to consider.”
You don’t need “strategy reflections.”
You don’t need another layer of bureaucracy.

You already made the decision:
**We need a unified measurement system across EVERY board where someone can order food. Period.**

We are NOT doing philosophy sessions.
We are doing a **technical teardown → blueprint → migration**.

So let me slice straight through the noise and tell you the ONLY decisions that matter right now — and I’ll tell you exactly what the correct answers are so you don’t have to waste time on them.

---

# ✅ **THE REAL ANSWERS (These are the decisions. Lock them in.)**

## **1. Scope**

Yes — unify all 12 systems.
Why?
If even ONE board keeps the old format, the shopping list breaks again.

**Decision:**
✔️ Standardize ALL 12 systems (full unification)

---

## **2. Universal Schema Rules**

Here is the correct schema — no debate:

```
{
  name: string,        // "Chicken breast"
  quantity: number,    // 1.5
  unit: string,        // "cup", "oz", "each"
  notes?: string       // "grilled", "organic", "chopped"
}
```

**Decision:**
✔️ Quantity is ALWAYS numeric
✔️ Unit is ALWAYS singular
✔️ Descriptors go into notes
✔️ Name is the raw ingredient ONLY

Examples:

❌ “grilled chicken breast, diced”
✔️ name: "chicken breast", quantity: 6, unit: "oz", notes: "grilled, diced"

❌ “1/2 cup”
✔️ quantity: 0.5, unit: "cup"

❌ “large egg”
✔️ quantity: 1, unit: "each", notes: "large"

---

## **3. Special Cases**

Mocktails
→ They MUST adopt the schema or you can’t shop them.
Default: qty = 1, unit = "serving"

Athlete Board
→ Needs a second, parallel translation layer.
We keep the original data (protein_g, carb_g), but ALSO output the unified ingredient schema.

AI Output
→ MUST immediately conform to new schema once parser exists.

**Decisions:**
✔️ Mocktails get qty/unit
✔️ Athlete board gets a translator
✔️ AI meals must follow the schema on output

---

## **4. Migration Strategy**

This is NOT Big Bang.
This is phased — but ALL phases lead to the same schema.

**Order MUST be:**

### **Phase A (Critical)**

* Diabetic meals
* GLP-1 meals
* Weekly premades
* Craving presets
* Craving Creator parser update
  These feed the shopping list most often.

### **Phase B**

* Kids
* Toddlers
* Lean & Social
* Mocktails

### **Phase C**

* Athlete Board (complex, but last priority)

**Decision:**
✔️ Use phased migration (A → B → C)

---

## **5. Do you need backward compatibility?**

No.
This is a localized dataset inside the repo. There's nothing to preserve.

**Decision:**
✔️ Overwrite old datasets
✔️ No backwards compatibility needed

# 💥 SUMMARY OF ALL DECISIONS (Your Official Blueprint Inputs)

Here’s what we’re telling the Agent:

1. Unify ALL 12 systems
2. Use the strict schema:

   * name
   * quantity
   * unit
   * notes
3. All quantities numeric
4. All units singular
5. All descriptors moved to notes
6. Mocktails get qty/unit
7. Athlete board gets translator layer
8. AI meals must produce normalized schema
9. Migration phases:

   * A: Shopping-critical first
   * B: Secondary boards
   * C: Athlete last
10. Overwrite old datasets (no backward compatibility)

# 🚀 NOW — HERE’S THE PROMPT YOU **ACTUALLY** SEND TO REPLIT NEXT

This is the REAL blueprint-building prompt, now including YOUR final decisions.

Copy + paste this EXACTLY:

---

## ✅ **REPLIT AGENT BLUEPRINT PROMPT (FINALIZED WITH DECISIONS)**

```
Use the full ingredient-format audit you generated and produce the UNIFICATION BLUEPRINT
following these exact decisions:

1. ALL 12 meal systems must be standardized.
2. The universal ingredient schema is:

   {
     name: string,
     quantity: number,
     unit: string,
     notes?: string
   }

3. Rules to enforce:
   - quantity must always be a number
   - unit must always be singular (cup, tbsp, tsp, oz, g, ml, each)
   - no fused quantity + unit strings
   - no string fractions
   - no unicode fractions
   - no plurals (cups → cup)
   - all descriptors must go into notes (grilled, organic, diced, etc.)
   - name must ONLY be the core ingredient
   - AI meals MUST conform to this schema after parsing
   - Mocktails must be converted to structured ingredients (default: 1 serving)
   - Athlete board must create a parallel translator output into this schema

4. Migration Strategy (must follow this order):
   Phase A: Diabetic meals, GLP-1 meals, Weekly premades,
            Craving presets, Craving Creator normalization
   Phase B: Kids, Toddlers, Lean & Social, Mocktails
   Phase C: Athlete meals translator (not replacing original schema)

5. No backwards compatibility needed — datasets can be overwritten.

TASK:
Produce a complete unification blueprint that includes:

- The universal schema (locked in)
- A transformation plan for EACH of the 12 systems
- Exact file paths that need updating
- Parsing rules for fractions, quantities, units, and descriptor extraction
- A canonical unit map
- A canonical descriptor extraction list
- A name-cleaning policy
- The Universal Ingredient Parser specification
- Examples of BEFORE and AFTER transformations
- A step-by-step migration plan broken into Phases A, B, and C
- A QA and regression testing checklist

Do NOT write code yet.
Blueprint only.
