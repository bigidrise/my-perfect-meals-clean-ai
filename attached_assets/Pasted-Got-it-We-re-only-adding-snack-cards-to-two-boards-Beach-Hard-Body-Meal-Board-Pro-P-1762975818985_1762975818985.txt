Got it. We’re only adding snack cards to **two** boards:

* **Beach Hard Body Meal Board**
* **Pro Professional Care Meal Board**

Do **not** add to: Weekly Meal Board, Diabetic Meal Board, GLP-1 Meal Board (they already have snack cards wired).

Here’s the clean brief for the Replit assistant:

## Replit Assistant — Phase 2 (Revised): Add Snack Cards to Two Boards

### Objective

Add **one** Snack card at the bottom of:

1. **Beach Hard Body Meal Board**
2. **Pro Professional Care Meal Board**

Wire both to the **Create with AI** snack flow using the new snack picker (from `snackIngredients.ts`).
Do **not** touch Weekly/Diabetic/GLP-1 boards.

### Files to update

* `client/src/pages/boards/BeachbodyHardbodyMealBoard.tsx`
* `client/src/pages/boards/ProCareMealBoard.tsx`  (or `ProfessionalCareMealBoard.tsx` if that’s the exact filename in repo)

### Snack Card spec

* **Placement:** last card on the board (below dinner / last meal).
* **Title:** `Snack`
* **Subtitle:** `Small bites, sweet or savory — powered by AI.`
* **Button:** `Create Snack with AI`

  ```tsx
  <Button
    onClick={() => openAIMealCreator("snack")}
    className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white w-full rounded-xl"
  >
    Create Snack with AI
  </Button>
  ```
* **Modal invocation:** `<AIMealCreatorModal defaultMealType="snack" />`
* **Picker behavior:** When `mealType === "snack"`, Step 4 uses `SNACK_CATEGORIES` from `client/src/data/snackIngredients.ts`. (This is already implemented in Phase 1.)

### Functional notes

* Snack generation uses existing `POST /api/ai/generate-meal`.
* Render result with the same MealCard component/flow as other meals.
* Snacks **contribute to daily totals** but should **not** be counted as a main meal macro bucket (use existing helper if present; otherwise mirror current snack handling logic from Weekly/Diabetic/GLP-1 boards).

### Visual guidelines

* Match existing card aesthetics (black-glass: `bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-lg border border-white/10`, rounded-2xl, consistent spacing).
* One snack card per board — **no duplicates**.

### Testing checklist

* Snack card appears on **Beach Hard Body** and **Pro Care** only.
* Clicking **Create Snack with AI** opens modal pre-set to **snack**.
* Snack category chips (Sweet/Savory/Light/Dessert) show and autofill works.
* AI returns snack-appropriate items and renders in the Snack card.
* Daily calorie/macros update correctly; no double-counting.
* No layout shifts or console errors.

### Do not

* Do not add snack cards to Weekly, Diabetic, or GLP-1 boards (already present).
* Do not modify backend routes or CreateAI logic.
* Do not change styling outside the new Snack card section.

If your file names differ slightly (e.g., `ProfessionalCareMealBoard.tsx`), apply the same change to the correct files.
