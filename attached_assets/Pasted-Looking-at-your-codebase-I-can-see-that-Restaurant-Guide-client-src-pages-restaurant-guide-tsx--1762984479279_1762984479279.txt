Looking at your codebase, I can see that:

Restaurant Guide (client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx) already has persistence implemented via localStorage with the cache key "restaurantGuide.cache.v1". It saves and loads generated meals.

Meal Finder (client/src/pages/MealFinder.tsx) also has persistence implemented via localStorage with the cache key "mealFinder.cache.v1". It saves and restores search results.

Both features are already persisting their data! However, I'll create a prompt for you to give to the Replit Agent to verify and ensure both persistence systems are working correctly:

🔍 Replit Agent Prompt — Verify & Ensure Restaurant Guide Persistence
Context:
The Restaurant Guide has two features that generate results:

Smart Restaurant Guide (main feature) - generates meals for a specific restaurant + craving
Meal Finder (secondary feature) - finds nearby restaurants by ZIP code + craving
Current State:
Both features already have localStorage persistence implemented, but we need to verify they're working correctly and ensure results persist across navigation/refresh.

Task:
Inspect and verify the persistence systems in these two files:

1️⃣ Restaurant Guide (client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx)
✅ Verify the cache key "restaurantGuide.cache.v1" is saving/loading correctly
✅ Confirm saveRestaurantCache() is called when meals are generated
✅ Confirm loadRestaurantCache() runs on component mount and restores meals
✅ Ensure the cached data includes: restaurantData, restaurant, craving, cuisine, generatedAtISO
✅ Make sure useEffect with empty dependency array [] loads cache on mount
✅ Make sure useEffect with [generatedMeals, ...] auto-saves when meals change
2️⃣ Meal Finder (client/src/pages/MealFinder.tsx)
✅ Verify the cache key "mealFinder.cache.v1" is saving/loading correctly
✅ Confirm saveMealFinderCache() is called in the mutation's onSuccess handler
✅ Confirm loadMealFinderCache() runs on component mount and restores results
✅ Ensure the cached data includes: results, mealQuery, zipCode, generatedAtISO
✅ Make sure search inputs are restored when cache is loaded
Expected Behavior:

User generates meals on Restaurant Guide → leaves page → returns → meals are still visible
User searches on Meal Finder → leaves page → returns → search results are still visible
Cache survives page refresh, navigation to other pages, and browser tab switching
If Issues Are Found:

Fix any missing localStorage.setItem() or localStorage.getItem() calls
Ensure state is properly restored to React components from cache
Add console logs for debugging if cache isn't loading
No New Features Needed:
Both systems already have persistence code — just verify it works as expected.
