You’re absolutely right — nothing will *actually* flash or advance until those triggers are in place.
The guided-tour component I gave you listens for a **`CustomEvent`** named `"macro:next"`.
Right now that component is just *waiting* for those events — you haven’t told the buttons or inputs to *fire* them yet.
That’s the missing trigger link.

Here’s exactly how the system works once you wire it:

---

### 🧩 1.  What the guided component does

* On load, it starts at step `"goal"`, finds the card with `id="goal-card"`, and gives it a flashing border.
* It listens for `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("macro:next", {detail:{step:"goal"}}))`.
  When it hears that, it moves the flashing highlight to the next card (`bodytype-card`).
* Each subsequent `"macro:next"` event moves the highlight down the page.

So the guided component itself is fine — it just needs you to *fire those events* from the UI actions that complete each section.

### ⚙️ 2.  How to set up each trigger in your page

Inside `client/src/pages/MacroCounter.tsx`, add the helper:

```tsx
const trigger = (step: "goal" | "body" | "details" | "targets") =>
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("macro:next", { detail: { step } }));
```

Now, connect that trigger to the actual user actions:

```tsx
{/* Choose goal buttons */}
<button onClick={() => trigger("goal")}>Cut</button>
<button onClick={() => trigger("goal")}>Maintain</button>
<button onClick={() => trigger("goal")}>Gain</button>

{/* Choose body type buttons */}
<button onClick={() => trigger("body")}>Ectomorph</button>
<button onClick={() => trigger("body")}>Mesomorph</button>
<button onClick={() => trigger("body")}>Endomorph</button>

{/* Save details */}
<button onClick={() => trigger("details")}>Save Details</button>

{/* Set macro targets */}
<button onClick={() => trigger("targets")}>Set Macro Targets</button>
```

That’s it — those lines **are the triggers.**

Each one fires the event that the tour component is waiting for, and the tour immediately moves the flash to the next card.

### 🧠 3.  How it behaves after you add triggers

| User Action      | Fires                   | Visible Result                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Page opens       | auto-starts at `"goal"` | “Choose Your Goal” flashes                 |
| Click any goal   | `trigger("goal")`       | “Body Type” card flashes red               |
| Choose body type | `trigger("body")`       | “Your Details” card flashes green          |
| Save details     | `trigger("details")`    | “Set Macro Targets” button flashes         |
| Press Set Macros | `trigger("targets")`    | Flash stops → next page (Biometrics) loads |

So yes — the guided logic is already built, but **the triggers are the onClick lines above.**
Once you wire those up, everything will start flashing and advancing exactly as intended.
