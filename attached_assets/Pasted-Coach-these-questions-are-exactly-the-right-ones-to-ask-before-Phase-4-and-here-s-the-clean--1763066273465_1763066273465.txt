Coach — these questions are **exactly the right ones** to ask before Phase 4, and here’s the clean, decisive answers so you can green-light the assistant with ZERO guesswork.

I’m going to lay this out as **final instructions**, no fluff, no confusion, no backtracking.

# ✅ **1. Which Lifestyle Diets to Populate?**

You chose **the top 7 lifestyle diets** from our earlier research.

These are the exact diets we are populating inside
`lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts`:

### **TOP 7 LIFESTYLE DIETS**

1. **Mediterranean**
2. **Vegan**
3. **Vegetarian**
4. **Pescatarian**
5. **Paleo**
6. **Keto**
7. **Flexitarian**

✔ Populate ALL seven.
✔ Populate ALL five meal categories (Proteins, Starches, Fibrous Carbs, Fats, Fruits).
✔ Populate ALL snack categories (Sweet, Savory, Light, Protein, Drinkables, Dessert).

---

# ✅ **2. Which Clinical Diets to Populate?**

We also selected the top 7 clinical diets from real usage across medical apps.

Populate these inside
`clinicalLifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts`:

### **TOP 7 CLINICAL DIETS**

1. **AIP (Autoimmune Protocol)**
2. **Low-FODMAP**
3. **Cardiac / Heart-Healthy**
4. **Renal / Kidney-Friendly**
5. **Bariatric Phases (Soft/Blend/Stage 3) — but we’ll treat it as one diet**
6. **Anti-Inflammatory**
7. **Liver-Friendly**

✔ Populate ALL seven.
✔ Populate ALL five meal picker categories.
✔ Populate ALL snack picker categories.

---

# ✅ **3. Ingredient Data Source**

We are **NOT** reusing the regular meal pickers.
Why?

Because those contain chicken, beef, pork, rice, etc.
which **aren’t allowed** in half of these diets.

### So the correct answer:

#### **Create NEW ingredient arrays per diet based on dietary rules.**

Example:

**Vegan proteins:**

* Tofu
* Tempeh
* Lentils
* Chickpeas
* Edamame
* Black beans
* Vegan protein powder
* etc.

**Keto proteins:**

* Salmon
* Eggs
* Chicken thighs
* Beef
* Tuna
* Turkey
* Protein powder
* etc.

### The assistant will build these ingredients completely new.

---

# ✅ **4. Snack Filtering**

Use **snackIngredients.ts** ONLY as a structural example.

Do **NOT** reuse the actual ingredients.

### What to do:

For each diet, create snack categories like:

* `sweetTreats: []`
* `savoryCrunchy: []`
* `lightGentle: []`
* `proteinEnergy: []`
* `drinkables: []`
* `dessertBites: []`

Example:

**Low-FODMAP Sweet Snacks**

* Strawberries
* Blueberries
* Lactose-free yogurt
* Maple syrup drizzle
* Gluten-free cookie (low-FODMAP)
* etc.

**Keto Sweet Snacks**

* 90% dark chocolate
* Keto protein bar
* Coconut chips
* Almond butter fat bombs
* etc.

### ALL snack ingredient lists must be diet-compliant.

---

# ✅ **5. Fallback Behavior**

If no diet is selected:

### **Show NOTHING.**

Why?

Because:

* They MUST pick a diet
* The builder is diet-driven
* A “general” option will give users meals that violate their diet rules

So the correct fallback is:

### ❌ Do NOT load all ingredients

### ❌ Do NOT load a general sheet

### ✔ Show: “Please choose a diet to continue”

This ensures the AI never creates a meal contradictory to their selected diet.

# 🚀 Coach — You’re good to green-light Phase 4 for the assistant.

If you want, I can now generate:

### → **The full detailed Replit Assistant Phase 4 implementation brief**

### → **The exact TypeScript structure for each config file**

### → **Sample ingredient lists per diet to copy/paste**

Just say: **“Give me the Phase 4 assistant brief”** or
**“Give me the ingredient structure”**.
