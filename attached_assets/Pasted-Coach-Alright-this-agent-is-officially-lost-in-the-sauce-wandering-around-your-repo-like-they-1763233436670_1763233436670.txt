Coach…
Alright, this agent is officially **lost in the sauce**, wandering around your repo like they’re searching for Easter eggs.

Here’s how we fix this **cleanly, directly, and with zero wiggle room.**

You’ve already built a **meal-builder system** that **ABSOLUTELY DOES** use meals — the Diabetes builder uses them through **its own file**, NOT through the ingredient drawers.

The agent is confusing TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS:

---

# 🚨 **SYSTEM A — INGREDIENT PICKERS (MealIngredientPicker / MealPickerDrawer)**

These are for:

* AI meal generation
* Fridge Rescue
* Craving Creator
* Raw ingredient selection

**This system DOES NOT use 40/40/40 meals.
It uses ingredients only.**

That part is fine.

---

# 🚨 **SYSTEM B — MENU BUILDERS (DiabeticMenuBuilder, AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder, GLP1MenuBuilder)**

These pages DO use:

* The **40 breakfasts**
* The **40 lunches**
* The **40 dinners**
* The **100 snacks**

**These are used in:**

* **Replace Meal**
* **Preset Meal Cards**
* **Generate Random Meal**
* **Auto Populate**
* **Shopping List**
* **Board Builder (Weekly Board)**
* **Meal Card Rendering**

The agent is literally looking in the wrong components.

---

# 🔥 **THE RIGHT FILE TO CONNECT MEALS**

The correct place is:

```
client/src/pages/AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx
```

NOT:

* MealIngredientPicker
* MealPickerDrawer
* AI Creator
* Ingredient-based systems

The 40/40/40 meals + 100 snacks plug into the **Meal Builder**, not the ingredient system.

---

# 🔥 **HERE IS THE EXACT PROMPT YOU HAND TO THE AGENT**

Copy/paste this **exactly**:

---

# 🚨 **AGENT — STOP. YOU ARE LOOKING IN THE WRONG SYSTEM. READ CAREFULLY.**

You are checking MealIngredientPicker and MealPickerDrawer —
**those are NOT used by the Menu Builder pages.**

The following file **IS** the one that must import and use all Anti-Inflammatory meals:

```
client/src/pages/AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx
```

This file is a direct duplicate of:

```
client/src/pages/DiabeticMenuBuilder.tsx
```

Therefore your job is simple and MUST follow the Diabetic pattern exactly.

---

# ✅ **1. These are the EXACT Anti-Inflammatory Meal Files already created**

```
client/src/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.breakfast.ts
client/src/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.lunch.ts
client/src/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.dinner.ts
client/src/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.snacks.ts
```

Use these files.
Do NOT search for anything else.
Do NOT attempt new systems.

---

# ✅ **2. Import them EXACTLY like the Diabetic Menu Builder imports its meals**

In **AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx**, add:

```ts
import { antiInflammatoryBreakfasts } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.breakfast";
import { antiInflammatoryLunches } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.lunch";
import { antiInflammatoryDinners } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.dinner";
import { antiInflammatorySnacks } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.snacks";
```

---

# ✅ **3. Connect them to the picker arrays EXACTLY like Diabetes**

Find where the Diabetic builder sets:

```ts
const breakfastMeals = diabeticBreakfasts;
const lunchMeals = diabeticLunches;
const dinnerMeals = diabeticDinners;
const snackMeals = diabeticSnacks;
```

You MUST create the Anti-Inflammatory equivalents:

```ts
const breakfastMeals = antiInflammatoryBreakfasts;
const lunchMeals = antiInflammatoryLunches;
const dinnerMeals = antiInflammatoryDinners;

const snackMeals = [
  ...antiInflammatorySnacks.sweet,
  ...antiInflammatorySnacks.savory,
  ...antiInflammatorySnacks.crunchy,
  ...antiInflammatorySnacks.creamy,
  ...antiInflammatorySnacks.highProtein
];
```

---

# ✅ **4. Verify the UI picks up ALL meals immediately**

* Breakfast picker → 40 meals
* Lunch picker → 40 meals
* Dinner picker → 40 meals
* Snack picker → 100 snacks
* Replace Meal → shows meals
* Weekly Board → uses meals
* Shopping List → uses meals

If ANY of these do not work:
**You wired it incorrectly. Fix it.**

---

# ❗ **DO NOT CHECK MealIngredientPicker. DO NOT CHECK MealPickerDrawer.**

Those are NOT part of this system.

Your job is ONLY to connect the 40/40/40/100 meals in **AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx** using the SAME pattern Diabetes uses.

---

# END PROMPT

Coach — hand them that and they will stop wandering around the repo like Scooby-Doo in a haunted mansion.
