Perfect — **this is exactly the energy we need**.
The assistant is finally reset and listening again.

Now you need to give the Replit assistant a *tight, surgical* follow-up so they stay locked into Phase 5 and don’t drift.

Here’s the exact message you should send them next:

---

# ✅ **SEND THIS TO THE REPL.IT ASSISTANT NOW**

(Use this exact wording — it keeps them laser-focused on the ONLY work allowed.)

---

# 🔧 **Phase 5: Verification + Completion Request**

You are correctly reset.
Here is what I need from you NOW:

---

# ✅ **1. VERIFY Phase 5 Implementation**

Check the following files and confirm ALL Phase 5 behavior is working:

### **Files to verify**

* `client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`
* `client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`
* `client/src/components/MealIngredientPicker.tsx`
* `client/src/data/lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts`
* `client/src/data/clinicalDietPickerConfig.ts`

### **Verify these 7 behaviors:**

1. When a diet is selected, the ingredient picker shows ONLY that diet’s ingredients.
2. When no diet is selected, the screen shows “Choose a diet to continue.”
3. MealIngredientPicker receives the correct `dietConfig` and `dietType` props.
4. The AI request includes:

   * `dietType`
   * selected diet ingredients
5. Diet selection persists in:

   * `lifestyle-diet-selection`
   * `clinical-diet-selection`
6. Snack cards still work correctly and are unchanged.
7. ALL other meal boards continue using regular ingredients and are untouched.

---

# ✅ **2. FIX ANY PHASE 5 ISSUES FOUND**

If you see ANY missing wiring, do ONLY the following:

* Fix the dietConfig passing
* Fix dietType passing
* Fix ingredient source logic
* Fix empty-state display

⚠️ **Do NOT:**

* Add backend routes
* Add guardrails
* Add migrations
* Add presets
* Add schemas

Only fix Phase 5 wiring.

---

# ✅ **3. ASK BEFORE MAKING ANY OTHER CHANGES**

If you are unsure about anything, stop and ask.
Do NOT assume.
Do NOT improvise.
Do NOT move to Phase 6.

---

# 🔒 **STRICT LIMITS**

You are forbidden from:

* Creating new tables
* Modifying existing tables
* Adding new server routes
* Changing backend logic
* Adding guardrail logic
* Creating extra features

Only Phase 5 verification + completion is allowed.

---

# 📌 **GOAL**

Finish Phase 5 CLEANLY so the two new boards:

* **Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder**
* **Clinical Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder**

are fully diet-specific and fully functional.

---

# End of instructions.

---

Coach — send that EXACT message to the Replit assistant.
It will force the assistant to stay in the box and finish Phase 5 correctly.

When they reply, send me their response and I’ll make sure they’re still aligned before they touch anything.
