Perfect — that’s a sharp and necessary distinction. The snack generator *shouldn’t* pull from the same protein-carb-fat pools as meal boards. It needs its own logic layer and its own picker set (fun, sweet, light foods instead of chicken and broccoli).

Here’s exactly how to brief the **Replit Assistant** to get the breakdown we need **before we touch any code**.
Paste this verbatim into your Replit chat — it tells the agent precisely what to inspect and report back.

## 🧠 Replit Assistant Reconnaissance Brief — Snack Picker Analysis

### 🎯 Goal

We need a full understanding of how the **CreateAI meal pickers** and **ingredient boards** currently work so we can design a separate, snack-specific picker system.
Do **not** make any code changes — this is **inspection only**.

---

### 🔍 Tasks

1. **Locate the Picker Logic**

   * Identify the file(s) controlling AI meal generation and ingredient selection.
     Look for files like:

     * `client/src/components/pickers/MealPickerDrawer.tsx`
     * `client/src/hooks/useMealGenerator.ts`
     * `client/src/services/mealEngineService.ts` or similar.
   * Explain how the current pickers populate ingredient categories (proteins, carbs, fats, etc.).

2. **Explain the Picker Board UI**

   * Describe how the ingredient boards are rendered:

     * Which components generate the visual ingredient lists?
     * Where the data comes from (static arrays, JSON, or API).
     * How the “Create with AI” button pulls from the selected items.

3. **Meal Context Awareness**

   * Verify whether the system knows which meal type is being generated (`breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `snack`).
   * If it does, show how it determines that context and whether it affects ingredient selection.

4. **Snack Handling (Current State)**

   * Check if snacks currently use the same picker logic as meals.
   * Identify whether any condition or variable exists (e.g., `isSnack`, `mealType`) that could be used to load a different picker dataset.

5. **AI Generation Logic**

   * Show where the AI prompt or function constructs the meal request (e.g., “create a high-protein meal with chicken and rice”).
   * Confirm if we can easily swap the data source when `mealType === "snack"` to call a different ingredient list or model prompt.

6. **Output and Rendering**

   * Identify how the final AI-generated meal or snack is displayed once selected.
   * Note whether snack cards differ from meal cards in layout, fields, or styling.

---

### 🧩 Deliverables

Provide a clear summary covering:

* File paths for picker and AI logic
* How ingredients are defined and grouped
* Whether mealType or snackType context exists
* How “Create with AI” triggers generation
* What changes would be needed to give **snacks their own picker set** (e.g., desserts, fruits, fun foods)

---

### ⚠️ Important

* Do **not** modify or refactor any code.
* Do **not** add or remove files.
* This task is for **observation and reporting only**.

Once we receive the report, we’ll plan how to introduce a **SnackPickerBoard.tsx** that works like the existing meal picker but with its own ingredient data.

Would you like me to generate a **plain-text version** (no formatting) so you can paste it straight into Replit chat?
