Perfect — that’s the right call. Let’s make this clean, scalable, and crystal clear for the Replit assistant so it knows **exactly** what to do and doesn’t break anything.

Here’s your full Replit Assistant brief 👇

## 🧾 Replit Assistant Brief — Add “Fruit” Category to Meal Ingredient Picker

### 🎯 Objective

We’re expanding the **meal ingredient picker system** (the one used in the “Create with AI” flow for the Weekly, GLP-1, and Diabetic meal boards) to include **Fruit** as a new category alongside **Protein**, **Starchy Carbs**, **Fibrous Carbs**, and **Fats**.

This update ensures users can select fruits easily when creating meals — and in the diabetic hub, it will display each fruit’s **glycemic index classification** (Low GI or Regular).

---

### 📍 Files to Work With

You’ll primarily be editing or adding to:

1. **`client/src/components/pickers/MealPickerDrawer.tsx`**

   * Add a **5th button** for “Fruit”.
   * The button should match the existing 4 buttons (same black-glass style, same hover effect, same shadow).
   * Label should simply read **“Fruit”** — no emoji (we’re removing emojis to save horizontal space).
   * Adjust the layout to fit 5 buttons cleanly:

     * Either use `grid-cols-5` for desktop.
     * Or make it **horizontally scrollable on mobile** (`overflow-x-auto flex-nowrap`).
   * Clicking the **Fruit** button should load the new `fruitIngredients.ts` dataset.

2. **`client/src/data/fruitIngredients.ts`**  ← New File

   * Create a new dataset file just like `proteinIngredients.ts`, `starchIngredients.ts`, etc.
   * Each fruit should have:

     ```ts
     { name: string; gi: "Low GI" | "Regular"; }
     ```
   * Example:

     ```ts
     export const fruitIngredients = [
       { name: "Apple", gi: "Low GI" },
       { name: "Banana", gi: "Regular" },
       { name: "Blueberries", gi: "Low GI" },
       { name: "Grapes", gi: "Regular" },
       { name: "Strawberries", gi: "Low GI" },
       // … continue until you have ~20 fruits total
     ];
     ```
   * Keep the list balanced between low- and regular-GI fruits.

3. **`client/src/services/mealEngineService.ts`**

   * Update the ingredient source logic to include Fruit.
   * Example:

     ```ts
     const ingredientSources = {
       protein: proteinIngredients,
       starch: starchIngredients,
       fiber: fiberIngredients,
       fat: fatIngredients,
       fruit: fruitIngredients, // ✅ new
     };
     ```
   * Ensure the AI generation prompt builder understands fruit selections:

     ```ts
     if (selected.fruit?.length) {
       prompt += ` Include fruit options such as ${selected.fruit.join(", ")} where appropriate.`;
     }
     ```

4. **`client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`**

   * Ensure “Fruit” shows up as a selectable ingredient category.
   * Maintain the new **“single ingredient is allowed”** behavior.

---

### 🧠 Behavior Notes

* All boards share the same **fruit dataset**, but the **Diabetic Meal Board** should display GI tags (e.g., “Apple – Low GI” or “Banana – Regular”).
* The AI engine already understands “mealType” context, so no backend changes are needed.
* Keep all card visuals, spacing, and styling consistent with existing ingredient pickers.

---

### ✅ Boards to Update

Apply this new Fruit category to these three:

1. Weekly Meal Board
2. GLP-1 Meal Board
3. Diabetic Meal Board (add GI label display)

Do **not** change the Athlete or Hard Body boards yet — they can inherit this later once confirmed.

---

### 🧩 Validation Checklist

* All three boards show a **“Fruit”** button in the ingredient picker.
* Selecting “Fruit” shows a list of ~20 fruits with GI tags.
* No layout breaking or text wrapping on mobile (horizontal scroll if necessary).
* AI generator includes fruit in meal creation output.
* Low GI fruits are visibly labeled in the Diabetic Hub.

### 🧾 Commit Message

```
feat(meal-pickers): add Fruit ingredient category to Weekly, GLP-1, and Diabetic boards with GI tags
```

Would you like me to include the initial **fruitIngredients.ts** dataset here (with about 20 entries split by GI type) so the assistant can just copy it in directly without guessing?
