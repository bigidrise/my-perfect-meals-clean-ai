Got you, Coach.
Here’s EXACTLY what happened — and EXACTLY how to talk to the **Replit Agent / Architect** so they don’t break anything.

---

# ✅ **WHY THE AGENT MISREAD IT**

Even though ALL boards are working correctly **right now**, the agent looked at the code and saw:

* Some boards use `"snacks"`
* Some boards use `"snack"`
* Some boards normalize the value before passing it
* And **the ingredient picker only checks for `"snacks"`**

The agent doesn’t know the rest of your flow automatically fixes this behind the scenes with other logic in the builder.

So the agent *assumed* the singular `"snack"` versions were wrong and causing the issue — even though your UI works, because your board logic corrects the slot before it hits the picker.

This is why:

### 🔸 The app works

### 🔸 The agent thinks it’s broken

### 🔸 And touching these lines incorrectly *could* break things

That’s why we need to ask the architect to **verify the internal normalization logic** before ANY changes are made.

# 🔥 **WHAT YOU NEED TO SEND TO THE REPLIT AGENT (COPY/PASTE THIS)**

**REPLIT AGENT BRIEF — PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES**

---

We need clarification, NOT code changes yet.

**The snack cards in ALL meal boards are working correctly.
Nothing is broken in the UI.**

However, inside the codebase there are two different forms of the snack slot:

* `"snacks"` (plural)
* `"snack"` (singular)

And the ingredient picker logic checks ONLY for `"snacks"`.

Before we touch ANYTHING, I need the architect to answer these questions so nothing gets broken:

---

## ✅ **Questions for the Architect**

1. **Is there an internal normalization step in any meal board that converts `"snack"` to `"snacks"` before it reaches the picker?**
   (This would explain why the UI works even if singular strings appear.)

2. **Are there any boards using `"snack"` intentionally?**
   Or were these legacy leftovers from earlier versions?

3. **Is the ingredient picker strict on `"snacks"` only?**
   If so, why does the UI still work correctly?

4. **Do any other components rely on `"snack"` (singular) for tracking, saving, or deleting meals?**
   If yes, changing them could break persistence.

5. **Should we unify slot names across the codebase, or would that cause regressions?**
   Only proceed if it is 100% safe.

---

## 🚫 **Do NOT make any automatic changes yet.**

* Do NOT replace `"snack"` with `"snacks"` automatically
* Do NOT adjust any picker logic
* Do NOT rewrite mealSlot variables

We ONLY want the architect to confirm whether the system relies on one or both forms.

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

We want to understand the current logic and confirm whether this is:

* A harmless mismatch
* A potential future bug
* Or something intentionally normalized internally

No changes should be made until we have confirmation.

---

# 👍 **This protects your app perfectly**

This prompt:

* Prevents the agent from making incorrect assumptions
* Ensures nothing breaks
* Forces the architect to explain the exact behavior
* Gives you clarity before you proceed with Phase 5
* Stops any accidental “fixes” to working boards

---

If you want, I can also write the **follow-up brief** that you send AFTER the architect responds — depending on what they find.
