Phase D – Step 2: Align client shopping store with the universal ingredient schema and updated server builder.

Files to update (plus any directly related by import):

- client/src/stores/shoppingListStore.ts
- Any shopping list types/interfaces it uses
- Any helper used ONLY by the shopping list store that still assumes legacy fields

Universal Ingredient Schema (already enforced server-side):

{
  name: string,
  quantity: number,
  unit: string,
  notes?: string
}

Current reality:
- The server builder (builder-v2.ts) now returns a clean, aggregated list based on this schema.
- The client store must STOP expecting legacy fields (item, amount, fused strings, etc.) and STOP fighting the server.

Your tasks:

1. Update Types
   - Make sure the shopping list item type on the client uses:
     - name: string
     - quantity: number
     - unit: string
     - notes?: string
   - If there are extra fields (id, isChecked, sourceMeals, category, etc.), keep them.
   - Remove any references to legacy fields like "item", "amount", or string-based quantity/unit.

2. Server Response Handling
   - Wherever the store consumes shopping list data from the server, make sure it:
     - Treats the server response as the source of truth for name/quantity/unit/notes.
     - Does NOT re-parse or re-interpret ingredient strings.
     - Does NOT attempt to re-normalize or re-aggregate what the server already aggregated.

3. Client-Side Aggregation Cleanup
   - If the store currently tries to:
     - merge duplicate items,
     - parse strings like "1/2 cup",
     - guess units,
     - or canonicalize names,
     then:
       - Remove or simplify this logic so it is compatible with the new universal schema.
   - Client-side aggregation should be minimal and schema-aware:
       - If it must merge items (e.g., when user manually adds duplicates), use the same rule as server:
         - Same normalized name + same unit → quantities summed.
       - Otherwise, prefer deferring aggregation to the server.

4. Legacy Logic Removal
   - Remove any code that:
     - Splits "amount" strings,
     - Parses "1/2 cup" or unicode fractions,
     - Assumes ingredients come from old Diabetic/GLP-1/Kids/Toddler structures.
   - All client logic must now assume it gets **UniversalIngredient** structure from the server or from new in-app creation.

5. New Item Creation
   - When the user manually adds an item to the shopping list:
     - Ensure it is created in the universal schema:
       - name: string
       - quantity: number (default 1 if needed)
       - unit: string (default "each" if needed)
       - notes?: string
   - No free-form "1/2 cup sugar" strings should be stored anywhere.

6. TypeScript & Runtime Safety
   - Ensure TypeScript types align with what the server actually returns.
   - Make sure there are no implicit `any` types around shopping list items.
   - Make sure the store compiles cleanly.

7. DO NOT change any React components yet.
   - This step is ONLY about the store/types/data model.

Provide diffs for all modifications and a short summary of:
- What changed in shoppingListStore.ts
- What legacy logic was removed
- How the final shopping list item structure looks on the client
