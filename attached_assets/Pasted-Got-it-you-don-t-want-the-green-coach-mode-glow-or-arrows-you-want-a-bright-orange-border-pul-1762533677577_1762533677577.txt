Got it — you don’t want the green “coach-mode” glow or arrows; you want a **bright orange border pulse** around the active tile or card so users immediately see where to go next.

Here’s how to do that cleanly without changing any other colors or icons:

---

### 1️⃣ Add an **orange flash animation**

In your global stylesheet (`globals.css`, `index.css`, or wherever you keep the pulse rules):

```css
@keyframes pulseBorderOrange {
  0%, 100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255,122,0,0.7);   /* brand orange glow */
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 12px 6px rgba(255,122,0,0.45);
  }
}

.flash-border-orange {
  animation: pulseBorderOrange 1.3s infinite;
  border: 2px solid rgba(255,122,0,0.9);        /* bright orange outline */
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

That’s the same orange you use throughout the app (`#FF7A00`).

---

### 2️⃣ Use it in the guided component

In **`MacroCalculatorTour.tsx`**, replace any green/red references with the new orange class:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!coachMode || !step) return;

  const map = {
    goal: "goal-card",
    body: "bodytype-card",
    details: "details-card",
    targets: "macro-targets-btn",
  } as const;

  const el = document.getElementById(map[step]);
  if (!el) return;

  el.classList.add("flash-border-orange");
  return () => el.classList.remove("flash-border-orange");
}, [step, coachMode]);
```

Now every active card gets an **orange flashing border** instead of green or red.

---

### 3️⃣ Keep the trigger logic the same

Your existing triggers (`window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("macro:next",{detail:{step}}))`) still control when the border moves; only the color changed.

---

### 4️⃣ Remove the arrow overlay

If that arrow currently appears because of an older onboarding or tooltip script, comment out or delete its render block (e.g., `CoachArrow`, `IntroArrow`, or whatever component draws it).
With the orange border pulse in place, you don’t need it—the highlight itself becomes the visual guide.

---

### ✅ Result

* When the Macro Calculator (or any guided page) opens, the first card border **flashes bright orange**.
* Each completed step triggers the next card to flash orange.
* No more arrows; the glow does all the guiding.
* The orange matches your brand gradient and fits the black-glass UI perfectly.

Would you like me to extend this same **orange border flash** style to the other guided components (Planner, Biometrics, Meal Builder, Lifestyle)?
