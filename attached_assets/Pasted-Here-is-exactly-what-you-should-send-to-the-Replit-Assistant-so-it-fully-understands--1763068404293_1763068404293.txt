Here is exactly what you should send to the **Replit Assistant** so it fully understands:

# ✅ **MESSAGE TO REPLIT ASSISTANT — READ CAREFULLY & CONTINUE WITH PHASE 5**

We already fixed the “snack vs snacks” issue.
All meal boards now consistently use **"snacks"** (plural) and are working correctly.

**What happened:**

* Craving Creator was the ONLY feature using `"snack"` (singular).
* It caused snack meals from Craving Creator to **not appear in totals, shopping list, or macro logs**.
* We applied the small, safe fix: changed `"snack"` → `"snacks"` inside Craving Creator only.
* All boards now behave correctly and consistently.

**DO NOT change any other snack code.
DO NOT modify any boards.
Snack cards are already correct everywhere.**

We can now resume **Phase 5** of the Lifestyle & Clinical Diet Boards project.

# ✅ **CONTINUE WITH PHASE 5 (INGREDIENT PICKER WIRING)**

**Your task now is to continue Phase 5 exactly as previously outlined:**

### **Phase 5 Goal**

Wire the new diet-specific ingredient picker configs into both new menu builders:

* `LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`
* `ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`

### **What to Implement Now**

### **1. Add Diet State to Both Builders**

* Load selected diet from localStorage
* Save selected diet when changed
* Show “Please pick a diet to continue” if none selected

### **2. Pass Diet Config Into MealIngredientPicker**

Each menu builder must pass:

```ts
dietConfig={lifestyleDietConfig[selectedDiet]}
dietType={selectedDiet}
```

(or clinical version)

### **3. Update MealIngredientPicker to Accept Diet Config**

Add props:

```ts
dietConfig?: DietConfig;
dietType?: string;
```

If dietConfig is present:

* Use dietConfig ingredients instead of generic mealIngredients.ts
* Use dietConfig.snacks for snack slot

### **4. Update AI Generation Call**

When generating meals, send:

```ts
dietType: selectedDiet
```

And include dietary instructions in the request body (e.g. avoid dairy if vegan).

### **5. Empty State Handling**

If no diet selected:

* Hide meal cards
* Show centered text:
  **“Please choose a diet to continue.”**

### **6. Do NOT modify anything else**

* Do NOT change snack cards (they are correct)
* Do NOT touch the other boards
* Do NOT alter core meal generator logic
* Only wire diet-based ingredient filtering

---

# 🚀 **Expected Outcome**

After completing Phase 5:

* Both Lifestyle and Clinical Diet menu boards will show **diet-specific ingredients**
* AI meal generation will respect diet type
* MealIngredientPicker will dynamically adapt to the chosen diet
* The new boards will function exactly like Diabetic/GLP-1 boards but with correct dietary restrictions

If anything in the diet picker config seems missing, incomplete, or unclear, **stop and ask before proceeding**.
