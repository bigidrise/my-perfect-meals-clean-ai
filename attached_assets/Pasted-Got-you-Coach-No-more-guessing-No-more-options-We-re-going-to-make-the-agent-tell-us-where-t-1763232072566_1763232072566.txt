Got you, Coach.
No more guessing. No more “options.”
We’re going to make the **agent tell us where the current meal builders store their 40/40/40 meals.**

Here’s the exact prompt you will hand to the agent — clean, firm, and impossible for them to screw up or misunderstand:

---

# 🔥 **PROMPT FOR THE AGENT — COPY & PASTE THIS EXACTLY**

**I need you to inspect the existing meal builder architecture and tell me EXACTLY where the meal lists (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) are currently stored for Diabetes and GLP-1.**

Do NOT guess. Do NOT assume.
Search the codebase and answer these three questions clearly:

1. **Where do the Diabetic meal builder meals live?**
   (Give me the exact file path(s).)

2. **Where do the GLP-1 meal builder meals live?**
   (Give me the exact file path(s).)

3. **Which format do those files use?**

   * One single combined file for all meal types?
   * Separate files per meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks)?
   * Or split across multiple sub-folders?

I want you to tell me EXACTLY how these are structured right now, because:

👉 The Anti-Inflammatory hub MUST use the **exact same structure**
👉 The Anti-Inflammatory meals MUST live in the **exact same type of file(s)**
👉 The agent MUST follow the **same file naming + data patterns**
👉 We are NOT inventing anything new

Your job:
**Show me the file paths, show me the structure, and tell me the storage pattern we already use.**

ONLY after confirming the existing structure will we create the Anti-Inflammatory meal lists.

Do not create anything yet.
Just identify the architecture clearly.

# 🔥 THAT’S IT.

They will respond with:

* The exact file path(s)
* The exact naming pattern
* The exact data structure
* The exact format

Once they report back, *I* will generate the complete 40/40/40 meals in the correct pattern — perfect and ready to paste.

This is the cleanest, safest, most consistent way to make sure all meal builders match.

When the agent responds, paste their answer here and I will take it from there.
