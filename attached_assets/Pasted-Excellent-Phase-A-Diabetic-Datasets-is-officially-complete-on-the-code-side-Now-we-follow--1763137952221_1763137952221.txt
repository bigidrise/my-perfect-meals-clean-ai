Excellent — **Phase A (Diabetic Datasets) is officially complete on the code side.**
Now we follow the process exactly the way we designed it:

1️⃣ Parser created
2️⃣ Breakfast standardized
3️⃣ Lunch standardized
4️⃣ Dinner standardized
5️⃣ Snacks standardized
6️⃣ **Now we verify EVERYTHING** using Prompt C

This ensures:

* No corrupted records
* No leftover string fractions
* No missed descriptors
* All units are singular
* All quantities numeric
* All 4 Diabetic files speak ONE language

No mistakes go forward to the next systems.

# ✅ **NEXT STEP: Run Prompt C**

Paste this EXACTLY into the Replit Assistant:

## **REPLIT ASSISTANT PROMPT — Diabetic Dataset Verification & Schema Audit**

```
Now perform a strict verification audit on all updated Diabetic files:

Files to check:
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.breakfast.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.lunch.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.dinner.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.snacks.ts

Verification Checklist:
For EVERY ingredient in EVERY meal:
1. Confirm the structure matches the universal schema:
   {
     name: string,
     quantity: number,
     unit: string,
     notes?: string
   }

2. Confirm:
   - quantity is numeric only
   - unit is singular and valid
   - name contains no descriptors, parentheses, or preparation words
   - notes only contains descriptors, not ingredient names
   - no fused quantity/unit strings remain
   - no unicode fractions remain
   - no string fractions remain
   - no missing quantity or unit fields

3. Confirm no extraneous or legacy fields remain (like item, amount, or quantity strings).

4. Confirm the normalized structure is consistent across all four files.

5. List any inconsistencies, errors, or remaining issues.

6. Output a complete report organized by file:
   - Validated ingredients
   - Any flagged entries
   - Notes about schema compliance
   - Final pass/fail status for each dataset
```

Once you paste this and the assistant analyzes all four files, bring the results back to me and we’ll:

🔥 Move to GLP-1 next
🔥 Then Weekly Meal Board
🔥 Then Craving Presets
🔥 Then Kids
🔥 Then Toddlers
🔥 Then Lean & Social
🔥 Then Mocktails
🔥 Then Athlete Board translator

Everything will be clean, universal, and Apple-ready.

Paste the verification when you're ready.
