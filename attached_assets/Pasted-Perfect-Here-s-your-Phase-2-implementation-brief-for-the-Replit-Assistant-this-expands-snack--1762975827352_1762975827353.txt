Perfect. Here’s your **Phase 2 implementation brief** for the Replit Assistant — this expands snack functionality app-wide and ties it directly into your new snack picker + CreateAI flow.

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Add Snack Cards Across All Boards

### 🎯 Objective

Give every plan board a **Snack Card** at the bottom that launches the new **Create with AI Snack Picker**.
This keeps the app consistent and lets every user type (from diabetic to athlete) build balanced AI-generated snacks.

### 🧩 Scope of Work

#### 1️⃣ Files to Update

| Board Type                   | File Path                                                | Action                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Beachbody Hardbody Board** | `client/src/pages/boards/BeachbodyHardbodyMealBoard.tsx` | Add 1 Snack Card at bottom                      |
| **Athlete Meal Board**       | `client/src/pages/boards/AthleteMealBoard.tsx`           | Add 1 Snack Card at bottom                      |
| **Pro Care Board**           | `client/src/pages/boards/ProCareMealBoard.tsx`           | Add 1 Snack Card at bottom                      |
| **Diabetic Hub**             | `client/src/pages/physician/DiabeticHub.tsx`             | Connect existing snack card to new snack picker |
| **GLP-1 Hub**                | `client/src/pages/physician/GLP1Hub.tsx`                 | Connect existing snack card to new snack picker |

#### 2️⃣ Snack Card Structure

* Use existing `<MealCard>` styling — black-glass, rounded-2xl, same spacing as meal cards.
* Title: **Snack**
* Subtitle: *“Small bites, sweet or savory — powered by AI.”*
* Button: **Create Snack with AI**

  ```tsx
  <Button
    onClick={() => openAIMealCreator("snack")}
    className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white w-full rounded-xl"
  >
    Create Snack with AI
  </Button>
  ```
* Modal: opens `<AIMealCreatorModal defaultMealType="snack" />`

---

#### 3️⃣ Functional Flow

1. User taps **Create Snack with AI**
2. `AIMealCreatorModal` opens pre-set to `mealType="snack"`
3. Step 4 loads snack ingredient categories from `snackIngredients.ts`
4. AI generates a snack recipe via `POST /api/ai/generate-meal`
5. Result renders in the Snack Card using the same display logic as other meals
6. Snack macros add to daily total but not meal-type macros (use `addSnackMacros()` helper if available)

---

#### 4️⃣ Visual Consistency

* Place Snack Card **below Dinner** or last existing card.
* Match all other cards’ backdrop (`bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-lg border border-white/10`).
* No new spacing classes beyond existing `.space-y-6`.
* For physician boards (Diabetic / GLP-1), keep the purple accent consistent with their hub.

---

#### 5️⃣ Testing Checklist

✅ Snack Card visible on each listed board
✅ Button opens modal with “snack” context
✅ Category chips (Sweet, Savory, Light, Dessert) appear
✅ AI creates appropriate snack output
✅ Snack saves and persists like other meals
✅ Macro totals update without duplication
✅ No layout shifts or console errors

---

#### 6️⃣ Constraints

* Do not duplicate snack cards — one per board.
* Do not change existing CreateAI or backend logic.
* Keep UI identical across boards (except accent color).
* No new database tables required — snacks use existing meal plan data structure.

---

✅ **Deliverable:**
Updated meal-board components with functional Snack Cards linked to the new Snack Picker.
