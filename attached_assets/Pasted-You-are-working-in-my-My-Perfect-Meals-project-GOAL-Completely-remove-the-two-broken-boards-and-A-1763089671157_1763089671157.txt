You are working in my My Perfect Meals project.

GOAL:
Completely remove the two broken boards and ALL traces of them so they are as if they never existed.

These are the files to REMOVE:
- client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
- client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx

There may also be backup/duplicate variants. If they exist, DELETE them too:
- client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx.backup
- client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx.backup
- Any file in client/src/pages whose name starts with:
  • "LifestyleDietMenuBuilder"
  • "ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder"

### TASKS

1. **Delete the files**
   - Physically delete:
     - client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
     - client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
   - Also delete any backup/duplicate variants with those names in the same folder.

2. **Remove all imports and references**
   - Search the ENTIRE codebase for:
     - "LifestyleDietMenuBuilder"
     - "ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder"
   - For every match you find:
     - Remove the import lines.
     - Remove any JSX usage, <Route> usage, or component references.
   - The goal: after you are done, these identifiers should NOT appear anywhere in the repo.

3. **Remove routes**
   - Search all router-related files (for example: anything in client/src/routes, AppRoutes, router.tsx, or similar) for any route that points to:
     - LifestyleDietMenuBuilder
     - ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder
     - Any path that was created specifically for these boards (for example anything like "/lifestyle-diet", "/lifestyle-diet-menu-builder", "/clinical-lifestyle-diet", etc.).
   - Delete those route objects/JSX elements entirely so the app no longer knows these routes exist.

4. **Remove nav buttons/links**
   - Search for any navigation element (button, card, link, menu item, etc.) that navigates to those routes, using:
     - "Lifestyle Diet", "Lifestyle Diet Menu", or similar label text
     - "Clinical Lifestyle Diet" or similar label text
   - Remove those buttons/links/cards from the UI so there is no way to click into those (now deleted) boards.

5. **Clean up and verify**
   - After all deletions:
     - Run the dev/build command for the project.
     - Fix any TypeScript or build errors that are *only* related to these removed files or routes by removing leftover references.
   - Confirm:
     - The app compiles successfully.
     - There are no references to "LifestyleDietMenuBuilder" or "ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder" anywhere in the repo.
     - Navigating through the Planner/Lifestyle/Clinical hubs does NOT show any 404-under-page weirdness tied to these boards.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT touch any other meal boards or builders (Athlete, Competition, ProCare, etc.).
- Your job is ONLY to surgically remove these two specific boards and their routes/references, and leave everything else exactly as it is.
