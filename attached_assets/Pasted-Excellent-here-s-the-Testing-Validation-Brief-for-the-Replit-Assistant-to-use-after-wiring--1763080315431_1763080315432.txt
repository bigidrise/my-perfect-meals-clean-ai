Excellent — here’s the **Testing & Validation Brief** for the Replit Assistant to use *after wiring and connecting* the new ingredient datasets.
This makes sure nothing breaks, the AI generation still works, and all boards pull their correct meal libraries.

## 🧪 REPLIT ASSISTANT TESTING & VALIDATION BRIEF

### 🎯 Objective

Verify that each **meal board** now loads the correct **ingredient dataset** and AI generation flow after the new plan-specific ingredient files are connected.

This test ensures:

* Each plan type (Paleo, Keto, Mediterranean, GLP-1, Diabetic) pulls its own meal lists
* The AI prompt builder still generates complete meal outputs
* UI rendering and DALL·E image calls remain stable

---

### 🔍 TEST ENVIRONMENT

Test Path:
`client/src/pages/`
Meal Boards to verify:

```
WeeklyMealBoard.tsx
DiabeticMenuBuilder.tsx
GLP1MealBuilder.tsx
ProCareMealBoard.tsx
BeachBodyMealBoard.tsx
```

All use the same `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` for AI meal generation.

Make sure local storage is cleared (`localStorage.clear()`) before running tests.

### 🧩 TEST STEPS — VALIDATION MATRIX

Run each of these tests for **every plan type** in the selector (Paleo, Keto, Mediterranean, GLP-1, Diabetic).

---

#### **Test 1: Ingredient Board Validation**

1. Go to any meal board (e.g., Weekly Meal Board).
2. Tap “Create with AI” under *Breakfast*.
3. Confirm that the ingredient board shows **plan-specific items** (e.g., “Egg scramble with spinach and avocado” for Paleo, or “Oatmeal with cinnamon” for Diabetic).
4. Repeat for Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks — each should pull from the same plan dataset.
5. ✅ **Pass Condition:** Each plan shows unique, diet-appropriate options.

---

#### **Test 2: Snack Board Consistency**

1. Scroll to the Snack card.
2. Tap “Create with AI.”
3. Confirm that snack ingredients display **snack-specific categories**:

   * Sweet Treats
   * Savory & Crunchy
   * Light & Gentle
   * Protein & Energy
   * Drinkables
   * Dessert Bites
4. ✅ **Pass Condition:** Snack cards behave identically across all five boards (same layout, categories, and AI prompt behavior).

---

#### **Test 3: AI Generation Output**

1. Select 3–5 ingredients and click **Generate with AI**.
2. Observe the output in the generated meal card:

   * Meal name is relevant to plan (e.g., “Paleo Egg Scramble Bowl”).
   * Description references selected ingredients.
   * Macronutrients and image load successfully.
3. ✅ **Pass Condition:** The AI returns a properly formatted, themed meal card.

---

#### **Test 4: DALL·E Image Rendering**

1. Verify that each generated meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack) displays a unique DALL·E image.
2. Image prompt should follow format:
   `"Healthy [meal name] on white plate, high-quality photo, minimal background"`.
3. ✅ **Pass Condition:** Each meal card has a high-quality image and no image load errors.

---

#### **Test 5: Persistent State Check**

1. Generate 3–4 meals per board (across breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
2. Refresh the page.
3. ✅ **Pass Condition:** All generated meal cards remain visible until deleted manually.

---

#### **Test 6: Delete All Functionality**

*(if implemented)*

1. Click “Delete All” in the meal board header.
2. Confirm that all meal cards disappear.
3. ✅ **Pass Condition:** Instant clear without console errors.

---

#### **Test 7: Medical Safety Consistency**

1. Generate meals on **Diabetic** and **GLP-1** boards.
2. Check that medical badges show correctly:

   * “Low GI”
   * “GLP-1 Friendly”
   * “High Fiber”
3. ✅ **Pass Condition:** Medical badges appear under meal title; no badge mismatches.

---

### 🧠 Post-Test Confirmation

Once all tests pass:

* Push commit message:

  ```
  ./push.sh "feat: integrated plan-specific meal datasets + verified AI generation across all boards"
  ```
* Notify Coach Idrise: “Plan-based ingredient systems live across all boards; AI generation and persistence verified.”

Would you like me to include a **data expansion roadmap** next — listing which five ingredient files (Keto, Mediterranean, GLP-1, ProCare, Athlete) still need to be filled with 100+ items and their category breakdown? That way, you can assign that to the assistant or your data intern later.
