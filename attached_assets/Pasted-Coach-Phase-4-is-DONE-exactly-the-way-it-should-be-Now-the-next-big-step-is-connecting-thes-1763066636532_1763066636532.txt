Coach — **Phase 4 is DONE exactly the way it should be.**
Now the next big step is **connecting these 14 populated diet configs to the ingredient pickers** so the Lifestyle & Clinical Diet Menu Boards actually *use* the new diet-specific ingredients.

But before we move to wiring, here’s the **exact assistant brief** you need to send to the Replit Assistant **to avoid ANY confusion** and get Phase 5 executed clean and correctly.

This brief tells it what Phase 4 accomplished, what exists now, and exactly what it must do next — with ZERO risk of breaking anything.

# ✅ **REPLIT ASSISTANT — PHASE 5 BRIEF (COPY & PASTE THIS)**

**Hi Assistant,**

We have completed **Phase 4** of the Lifestyle & Clinical Diet system. Before you continue, here is a full summary of what’s already done and what you need to do next.

---

# ✅ **WHAT IS ALREADY DONE (DO NOT REBUILD)**

### ✔️ We now have 14 fully populated diet configurations:

### **7 Lifestyle Diets**

* mediterranean
* vegan
* vegetarian
* pescatarian
* paleo
* keto
* flexitarian

### **7 Clinical Diets**

* low_fodmap
* aip (Autoimmune Protocol)
* cardiac
* renal
* bariatric
* anti_inflammatory
* liver_friendly

### ✔️ Every diet config contains:

* proteins[]
* starchyCarbs[]
* fibrousCarbs[]
* fats[]
* fruits[]
* snacks{} with 6 snack categories:

  * sweetTreats
  * savoryCrunchy
  * lightGentle
  * proteinEnergy
  * drinkables
  * dessertBites

### ✔️ Config files **already exist**:

```
client/src/data/lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts
client/src/data/clinicalDietPickerConfig.ts
```

### ✔️ The dropdown selectors already exist in:

```
LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
```

**You do NOT need to create any more files or data.
Everything needed is already in place.**

---

# 🧠 **YOUR PHASE 5 TASK — WHAT YOU MUST DO**

You now need to **wire these diet configs** into the ingredient picker system:

### 1. When a diet is selected from the dropdown:

The meal picker for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks must pull ingredients from the corresponding config:

* For lifestyle diets → from lifestyleDietPickerConfig
* For clinical diets → from clinicalDietPickerConfig

### 2. Replace the existing ingredient source logic:

Currently, meal pickers use the **general** ingredients from:

```
client/src/data/mealIngredients.ts
```

For these two new hubs, **STOP using that file.**
Instead, use the diet-specific config based on dropdown selection.

### 3. Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner must use:

* proteins
* starchyCarbs
* fibrousCarbs
* fats
* fruits

### 4. Snacks must use:

* snacks.sweetTreats
* snacks.savoryCrunchy
* snacks.lightGentle
* snacks.proteinEnergy
* snacks.drinkables
* snacks.dessertBites

### 5. If NO diet is selected:

Do **not** load any ingredients.
Show a message:
**“Please choose a diet to continue.”**

### 6. Do NOT change:

* UI layout
* AI modal logic
* DALL·E integration
* Guardrails
* Snack card logic

All we are doing now is **connecting the new configs to the existing pickers.**

# 📌 **FILES YOU WILL MODIFY (ONLY THESE)**

### 1. Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder

```
client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
```

### 2. Clinical Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder

```
client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
```

### 3. Ingredient Picker Component

Whichever picker these menu builders use:

```
client/src/components/pickers/MealPickerDrawer.tsx
client/src/components/pickers/SnackPickerDrawer.tsx
client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx
```

(Only make adjustments needed to swap ingredient sources.)

---

# 🛑 **DO NOT TOUCH THESE FILES**

* Diabetic Menu Builder
* GLP-1 Menu Builder
* Weekly Meal Board
* mealIngredients.ts
* snackIngredients.ts
* Any existing meal picker logic for other boards

---

# 🎯 **YOUR GOAL**

Make the Lifestyle & Clinical Diet boards use
**their OWN ingredients**,
based on the selected diet,
exactly like the Diabetic and GLP-1 systems —
but diet-specific instead of medical-specific.

If you need any questions answered before continuing, ask me.

# ✅ Coach — this is the perfect brief for the assistant.

Clear. Complete. Zero ambiguity. Zero guesswork.

If you want, I can now write:

### ✔ The exact wiring code

### ✔ The ingredient picker logic patch

### ✔ The diet-to-picker mapping function

### ✔ A test checklist for all 14 diets

Just tell me:
**“Give me the wiring code”**
or
**“Give me the mapping logic”**
