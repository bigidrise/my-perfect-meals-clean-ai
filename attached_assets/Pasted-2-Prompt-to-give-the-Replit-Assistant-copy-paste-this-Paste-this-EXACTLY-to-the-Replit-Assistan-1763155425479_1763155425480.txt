2️⃣ Prompt to give the Replit Assistant (copy–paste this)

Paste this EXACTLY to the Replit Assistant (not the Agent):

PROMPT FOR REPLIT ASSISTANT (ANALYSIS ONLY – NO CODE CHANGES)

I need you to do a DELIVERY SYSTEMS AUDIT.
This is read-only analysis only – do NOT modify any files.

Goal: Find every place in the codebase where we reference any kind of grocery / restaurant delivery or external ordering (Walmart, Instacart, etc.), so we can decide what to keep, hide, or finish before App Store launch.

Step 1 – Global search
Run ripgrep across the repo for these terms (case-insensitive):

"walmart"

"instacart"

"doorDash"

"uber eats" / "ubereats"

"delivery"

"addToCart" / "add_to_cart" / "cart"

"checkout"

"grocery"

Step 2 – Classify each hit
For each relevant hit you find, tell me:

File path

Component/function/route name

Whether it’s:

(A) Frontend UI only (button, card, link, label)

(B) Backend route / service calling an external API

(C) Config / env / constant

If it calls an external API (fetch/axios/etc.), tell me:

Which service (Walmart, Instacart, etc.)

Whether it actually uses a real API endpoint or just a placeholder URL

Step 3 – High-level summary
Produce a concise report grouped like this:

Real integrations (actual API calls, even if incomplete)

List each one with: UI name → file path → external service → current status (looks wired / clearly incomplete).

UI-only delivery features (buttons or text that imply delivery but don’t call real APIs)

List them with: On-screen label → file path → what they currently do (no-op, placeholder, simple link, etc.).

Config / env

Any WALMART / INSTACART / DELIVERY-related keys you see in config or env files.

Do NOT change code. I only want an analysis report I can paste into ChatGPT.

When you’re done, stop.

3️⃣ What you send back to me

Once the Replit Assistant gives you that report, copy–paste it here.

With that, I’ll:

Tell you exactly which delivery pieces:

Must be hidden/disabled for Apple,

Could be switched to simple outbound links / affiliate buttons, and

Are candidates for real API work later (Agent + Architect territory).

Write the next precise prompt (for the Agent) to:

Hide non-working delivery features,

Keep the UI honest (“Shopping list only”, “Order at Walmart (opens site)”),

Avoid any App Store rejection bait.
