Perfect — that’s exactly the disciplined step we take before building Phase E.
We don’t guess; we pull precise specs from the codebase first.

Here’s the **Replit Agent briefing prompt** you’ll send — it tells the agent exactly what to inspect and report back, without changing anything yet.

## 🧾 Replit Agent Briefing — Phase E Preparation (Integrating GLP-1 Guardrails into ProCare Dashboard)

### 🎯 Goal

Before building Phase E, we need a full picture of how the **ProCare Dashboard** currently works—its files, components, routes, and data sources—so we can safely integrate GLP-1 data and guardrails.

Do **not** code or edit anything yet.
Your job is to **collect and summarize** all relevant information for Phase E planning.

---

### 🔍 Tasks — Information to Collect and Report Back

1. **Dashboard Structure**

   * Identify the file(s) defining the **ProCare Dashboard** UI.
     Examples:

     * `client/src/pages/procare/PatientAssignmentDashboard.tsx`
     * `client/src/pages/procare/PatientList.tsx`
   * Confirm which components render the **patient list**, **metrics cards**, and **action buttons**.

2. **Routes and Navigation**

   * List all routes that relate to the ProCare Dashboard, for example:

     * `/procare/patient-assignment`
     * `/procare/patient/:id`
   * Identify where these routes are registered in `client/src/router.tsx` (or similar).

3. **Data Sources**

   * Find how patient data is currently loaded:

     * Which API endpoint(s) populate the dashboard? (`/api/patients`, `/api/diabetes/profile`, etc.)
     * What React Query hooks or fetchers are used? (`usePatients`, `useAssignments`, etc.)
   * Determine whether each patient record already includes:

     * Diabetes guardrails
     * GLP-1 guardrails
     * Latest glucose or shot readings

4. **Backend Integration**

   * Locate the server routes powering the ProCare Dashboard:

     * Where do patient lists and metrics come from (`server/routes/patients.ts`, `server/routes/procare.ts`, etc.)?
   * Confirm whether these routes already join with `diabetes_profile` or `glp1_profile` tables.

5. **UI Capabilities**

   * Note all current actions available to clinicians on the dashboard:

     * “View” / “Edit” patient guardrails?
     * “Assign Preset”?
     * “View Audit History”?
   * Confirm which buttons are functional versus placeholders.

6. **Schema and Models**

   * Check `server/db/schema/patientAssignment.ts` and any related models:

     * Does it already import `glp1Profile` or `glp1AuditLog`?
     * If not, note which joins or foreign keys would be required.

### 🧩 Deliverables

Return a concise report summarizing:

* **File paths** for the ProCare Dashboard (frontend + backend)
* **Route structure**
* **Hooks and API calls**
* **Database tables referenced**
* **Existing or missing GLP-1 integration**
* **Any potential conflicts or duplication** with diabetic data

---

### ⚠️ Do Not

* Modify any files.
* Create new routes or tables.
* Delete anything.
* Commit any changes.

This is **a reconnaissance task only**.

---

### ✅ Ask Back Before Coding

Once you gather that data, confirm these three points before we start Phase E development:

1. *Which files handle patient fetching and rendering in the ProCare Dashboard?*
2. *Where in the backend are patient guardrails joined or fetched (if anywhere)?*
3. *Do we already have a clinician-to-patient relationship table, or does it need to be added?*

Would you like me to produce a **copy-ready plain-text version** (no Markdown formatting) so you can paste it directly into Replit chat for the assistant?
