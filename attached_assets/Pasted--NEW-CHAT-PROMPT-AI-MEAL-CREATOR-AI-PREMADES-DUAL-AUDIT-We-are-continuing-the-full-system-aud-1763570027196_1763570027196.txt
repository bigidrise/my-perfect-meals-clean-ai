📌 NEW CHAT PROMPT — AI MEAL CREATOR + AI PREMADES DUAL AUDIT

We are continuing the full-system audit of all meal generators before building the global UnifiedMeal architecture.

You’ve already audited:

Fridge Rescue (AI + deterministic)

Craving Creator

Restaurant Guide

Find Meals Near Me

Now audit these next two systems together:

A. AI Meal Creator
B. AI Premades

Produce a dual audit report that includes:

1. FRONTEND SUMMARY for BOTH

For each system:

File paths

Components involved

API endpoints being called

Request payload structure

Expected response shape

Meal card rendering

Image handling (AI or no AI)

Macros (flat vs nested)

Ingredient formatting (strings vs structured objects)

Instruction formatting (string vs array)

Medical badge handling

Any fallback logic

Local state or localStorage patterns

Any inconsistencies or legacy fields

2. BACKEND ROUTES SUMMARY

For both systems:

File paths

All API routes involved

Validation rules

Services called

Whether using deterministic or OpenAI

Response formats returned by backend

Any mismatch between route A and route B (legacy vs new)

Any “hidden” or unused routes

3. BACKEND SERVICES SUMMARY

For both systems:

Generation method (OpenAI vs deterministic vs hybrid)

Image generation behavior

Prompt structure

Nutrition logic (AI vs computed)

Ingredient structure

Instruction structure

Medical badge generation (strings vs objects)

Any inconsistencies with Craving Creator / Fridge Rescue / Restaurant systems

Known failure conditions or fallback code

4. CURRENT TYPES / INTERFACES

Extract actual types used by:

AI Meal Creator

AI Premades

Include:

Full field lists

Optional vs required fields

Nested vs flat macros

Ingredient shape

Instruction shape

Medical badge structures

Extra fields UnifiedMeal will not need

Missing fields UnifiedMeal WILL need

5. DIFF vs other four audited systems

Compare these two systems to:

Fridge Rescue

Craving Creator

Restaurant Guide

Find Meals Near Me

Highlight every mismatch:

Naming differences

Missing fields

Extra fields

Macros inconsistencies

Ingredient inconsistencies

Instruction inconsistencies

Medical badges inconsistencies

Image object inconsistencies

Restaurant metadata (if any)

Null patterns, undefined patterns, defaults

Fields that conflict with unification

6. FINAL SUMMARY — MIGRATION PRIORITIES

Organize into:

🟥 HIGH Priority — must fix before unification

🟧 MEDIUM Priority — fix soon

🟩 LOW Priority — can ignore or drop

⚠️ Structural blockers to unification

⚙️ Opportunities to simplify or standardize
