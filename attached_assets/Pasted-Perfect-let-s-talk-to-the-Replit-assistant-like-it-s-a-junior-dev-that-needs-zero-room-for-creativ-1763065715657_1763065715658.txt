Perfect, let’s talk to the Replit assistant like it’s a junior dev that needs zero room for “creativity.”

Below is a **copy-paste ready brief** you can feed straight into the Replit Assistant.
It’s broken into **phases**, exactly like you asked.

---

## 🔧 REPLIT ASSISTANT BRIEF — Phase 1–3 for Lifestyle & Clinical Diet Meal Boards

We’re going to extend the app with **two new meal boards** based on the existing **Diabetic Meal Board**.

**DO NOT touch any hubs, guardrail logic, or pickers yet** beyond what I explicitly tell you.
This is a phased implementation. Stick to the phases.

---

### 📂 SOURCE TO CLONE FROM

Use the **Diabetic Meal Board** as the base:

* Route: `"/diabetic-menu-builder"`
* File: locate by searching for that route in the router and matching page file
  Likely something like:
  `client/src/pages/physician/DiabeticMenuBuilder.tsx`
  or
  `client/src/pages/DiabeticMenuBuilder.tsx`

👉 **First task:**
Search the codebase for `/diabetic-menu-builder` and identify the **exact file** that renders the **Diabetic Menu Builder** page.
We’ll call that **`DiabeticMenuBuilder`**.

---

## 🧱 PHASE 1 — Clone Diabetic Meal Board into Two New Boards & Wire Routes

### 1. Create Two New Builder Pages

From the **Diabetic Menu Builder** file, create:

1. `client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`
2. `client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`

Both should be **1:1 clones** of the Diabetic Meal Board **for now**:

* Keep the same layout
* Keep the same header structure
* Keep the same React structure and hooks (we’ll change data later)
* Keep snack card, DALL·E images, logging, etc.
* **Remove/disable any diabetic-specific wording in the header** (text only, no logic changes):

  * Example: change titles like
    `"Diabetic Meal Board"` → `"Lifestyle Diet Meal Board"`
    `"Diabetes-Friendly Meals"` → `"Lifestyle Diet Meals"`

For the clinical builder:

* `"Clinical Lifestyle Meal Board"` or similar top heading text.

Do **NOT** change:

* AI modal wiring
* Card layout
* Add/log buttons
* Snack behavior
* LocalStorage logic
* Any diabetic/GLP logic that isn’t clearly text

We’ll swap pickers and constraints later.

---

### 2. Add Routes for These Two New Pages

Locate the main app router file:

* Likely: `client/src/components/AppRouter.tsx` or similar.

Add two new routes:

```tsx
<Route path="/lifestyle-diet-menu" component={LifestyleDietMenuBuilder} />
<Route path="/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu" component={ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder} />
```

Use whatever routing pattern the app already uses (Wouter, etc.).
The key is that:

* `/lifestyle-diet-menu` → `LifestyleDietMenuBuilder`
* `/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu` → `ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder`

---

### 3. Connect Planner Page Buttons to These New Routes

You already created buttons on the **Planner page** for:

* Lifestyle Diet Hub / Board
* Clinical Lifestyle Diet Hub / Board

Find the Planner page file (likely something like):

* `client/src/pages/Planner.tsx`
* Or `client/src/pages/planner/PlannerDashboard.tsx`

You should already see buttons like:

* `"Lifestyle Diet Hub"` or `"Lifestyle Diet Board"`
* `"Clinical Lifestyle Diet Hub"` or `"Clinical Lifestyle Diet Board"`

Update the `onClick` / `setLocation` for those buttons to:

```ts
setLocation("/lifestyle-diet-menu");
setLocation("/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu");
```

So:

* **Lifestyle button** → `/lifestyle-diet-menu`
* **Clinical button** → `/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu`

✅ At the end of Phase 1:

* Both routes exist
* Both pages render cloned Diabetic Meal Boards with updated titles
* Buttons on the Planner page correctly navigate to them
* No logic differences yet, only text/header naming

---

## 🧱 PHASE 2 — Add Diet Selector Dropdown to Each New Meal Board

Now we add a **diet mode selector** to the top of each new board.
This is just **UI + basic state** for now, no data switching yet.

### 1. Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder — Diet Select

In `LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`, add a **diet dropdown** near the top of the page, just under the main header, before the meal cards.

Dropdown label: `“Choose Lifestyle Diet”`.

The options should be:

```ts
// internal values are important; use these exact strings:
"mediterranean"  // Mediterranean
"vegan"
"vegetarian"
"pescatarian"
"paleo"
"keto"
"flexitarian"
```

Implementation details:

* Use `useState` to track selected diet, e.g.:

  ```ts
  const [dietMode, setDietMode] = useState<"mediterranean" | "vegan" | "vegetarian" | "pescatarian" | "paleo" | "keto" | "flexitarian">("mediterranean");
  ```

* Use the app’s existing `<select>` or custom select styling, matching the **black glass** aesthetic used elsewhere (e.g., GLP-1 Hub / Diabetic Hub / ProCare styles).

* This dropdown will **NOT** change any data yet — do **NOT** wire it to ingredient logic for now.
  Just make sure:

  * It renders correctly
  * It updates `dietMode` state
  * We can see the selected value in dev (you can temporarily log it to console if needed)

### 2. Clinical Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder — Diet Select

In `ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`, add a similar dropdown:

Label: `“Choose Clinical Diet”`.

Options:

```ts
// internal values:
"low_fodmap"        // Low-FODMAP
"aip"               // Autoimmune Protocol
"cardiac"           // Heart-Healthy
"renal"             // Kidney / Renal Friendly
"bariatric"         // Bariatric Protocol
"anti_inflammatory" // Anti-Inflammatory
"liver_friendly"    // Liver-Friendly
```

State:

```ts
const [clinicalDietMode, setClinicalDietMode] = useState<
  "low_fodmap" |
  "aip" |
  "cardiac" |
  "renal" |
  "bariatric" |
  "anti_inflammatory" |
  "liver_friendly"
>("low_fodmap");
```

Same rules:

* Visually match the Diabetic/GLP pages (black glass, rounded, small label, etc.)
* No data changes yet
* Just a working dropdown with correct state

✅ At the end of Phase 2:

* Both new boards have a functioning dropdown selector
* No ingredient switching logic has been implemented yet

---

## 🧱 PHASE 3 — Prepare for Diet-Based Picker Swapping (NO FULL IMPLEMENTATION YET)

In this phase, you are **only setting up the structure**, not the full ingredient lists.

### 1. Create Diet Picker Mapping Skeletons

Create two new files:

* `client/src/data/lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts`
* `client/src/data/clinicalDietPickerConfig.ts`

Each file should export **empty config objects** keyed by diet mode, which we will fill in later.

Example for **lifestyle**:

```ts
// client/src/data/lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts

export type LifestyleDietKey =
  | "mediterranean"
  | "vegan"
  | "vegetarian"
  | "pescatarian"
  | "paleo"
  | "keto"
  | "flexitarian";

// This will later point to per-diet ingredient sets.
// For now, leave the values as empty objects/placeholders.
export const lifestyleDietPickerConfig: Record<LifestyleDietKey, any> = {
  mediterranean: {},
  vegan: {},
  vegetarian: {},
  pescatarian: {},
  paleo: {},
  keto: {},
  flexitarian: {},
};
```

Example for **clinical**:

```ts
// client/src/data/clinicalDietPickerConfig.ts

export type ClinicalDietKey =
  | "low_fodmap"
  | "aip"
  | "cardiac"
  | "renal"
  | "bariatric"
  | "anti_inflammatory"
  | "liver_friendly";

export const clinicalDietPickerConfig: Record<ClinicalDietKey, any> = {
  low_fodmap: {},
  aip: {},
  cardiac: {},
  renal: {},
  bariatric: {},
  anti_inflammatory: {},
  liver_friendly: {},
};
```

### 2. Wire These Configs into the New Builders (Structure Only)

In:

* `LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`

  * Import `lifestyleDietPickerConfig` and `LifestyleDietKey`.
  * Where the picker or AI modal props are currently wired to **diabetic** or **standard** ingredients, **add a TODO-style structure**:

    ```ts
    // PSEUDO ONLY – DO NOT CHANGE FUNCTIONAL LOGIC YET
    const activePickerConfig = lifestyleDietPickerConfig[dietMode];
    ```

    Do **not** actually swap out the ingredient arrays yet.
    Just make sure the structure is in place and compiles.

* `ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`

  * Same idea:

    ```ts
    const activeClinicalPickerConfig = clinicalDietPickerConfig[clinicalDietMode];
    ```

Again:
**Do not change any behavior yet.**
We’ll come back later and plug in real picker data per diet.

✅ At the end of Phase 3:

* We have:

  * Two new builder pages cloned and routed
  * Diet dropdowns in both
  * Skeleton config maps for diet-based ingredient pickers
  * Placeholder variables that reference the right config based on selected diet

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU MUST NOT TOUCH

Until explicitly told later, **do NOT**:

* Change any existing snack pickers
* Change Weekly Meal Board behavior
* Change Diabetic or GLP-1 board logic
* Implement paywall logic (diet access locking)
* Modify AI prompt builders beyond adding harmless placeholders
* Delete or refactor shared components

This phase is **structural only**:

* Clone → Route → Dropdowns → Config skeletons.

---

## ✅ DONE CHECKLIST

Before you stop:

* [ ] `/lifestyle-diet-menu` renders a cloned Diabetic-style board with new header + lifestyle dropdown
* [ ] `/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu` renders a cloned Diabetic-style board with new header + clinical dropdown
* [ ] Planner buttons correctly navigate to those routes
* [ ] No TypeScript or runtime errors
* [ ] New config files compile and are referenced in the new builders

Once this is stable, we’ll move to the next phase:
**populating per-diet ingredient pickers and wiring AI constraints.**

---

Coach: you can drop that entire block straight into the Replit Assistant.
If you want, next step I can write the **Phase 4 brief** for wiring actual ingredients per diet once this scaffolding is in and stable.
