Got you, Coach.
Let’s reset the assistant **cleanly**, pull it back to the correct lane, and give it a crisp, controlled brief that **prevents ANY future over-building**.

This message will realign the assistant, stop it from guessing, stop it from jumping ahead, and force it into step-by-step execution exactly the way YOU want.

---

# ✅ **SEND THIS TO THE REPL.IT ASSISTANT**

(Use this exact wording — it’s designed to lock the assistant down.)

---

# 🚫 STOP. RESET. CORRECTION 🚫

The previous Phase 6 implementation you started is **NOT approved** and must NOT proceed.

You misinterpreted the work because the chat session was lost.

Here is the correct alignment:

---

# ✅ **What We ARE Doing**

We are currently working on **Phase 5 ONLY**:

**PHASE 5:**
Integrating *diet-specific ingredient pickers* into the two new boards:

* Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder
* Clinical Lifestyle Diet Menu Builder

These pickers use the new diet config files:

* `lifestyleDietPickerConfig.ts`
* `clinicalDietPickerConfig.ts`

Phase 5 includes:

1️⃣ Passing the correct diet config to `MealIngredientPicker`
2️⃣ Updating AI request with `dietType`
3️⃣ Showing diet-specific ingredients for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks
4️⃣ Showing “Choose a diet to continue” when no diet selected
5️⃣ Persisting diet selection in localStorage

**THIS is the phase you should be working on. Nothing else.**

---

# ❌ **What We Are NOT Doing**

You should NOT:

* Create new migrations
* Create new database tables
* Create audit logs
* Create backend routes
* Create guardrail schemas
* Add guardrail UI
* Add presets
* Add hooks
* Modify the server
* Implement storage
* Build Phase 6
* Build guardrails at all

None of that has been approved yet.

---

# 📌 **What You Must Do Right Now**

1. **Pause all work.**
2. **Re-read the Phase 5 brief.**
3. **Wait for me to send explicit instructions to continue Phase 5.**
4. **Ask questions only about Phase 5 if needed.**

Do NOT attempt to implement guardrails.
Do NOT attempt to interpret next phases.
Do NOT create ANY database changes.

---

# 🎯 GOAL FOR THIS PHASE (ONLY)

Finish the correct Phase 5:

* Diet-specific ingredient pickers
* AI integration
* No backend changes
* No guardrails

After Phase 5 is fully complete, tested, and approved by COACH, then and only then we will move to Phase 6.

---

# ❗IMPORTANT

PREVENT over-building.
PREVENT schema changes.
PREVENT backend modifications.
STRICTLY follow the phase plan.

# End of message.

Coach — this will slam the brakes on the agent and force them back into the correct lane.

Just paste it, send it, and they’ll realign instantly.
