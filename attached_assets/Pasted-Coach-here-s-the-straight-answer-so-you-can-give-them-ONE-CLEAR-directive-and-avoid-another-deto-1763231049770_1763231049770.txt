Coach — **here’s the straight answer so you can give them ONE CLEAR directive and avoid another detour:**

They’re confused because your app currently has **two different systems**:

1. **Single-screen info modal**
   (Used in Diabetes Hub + GLP-1 Hub)

2. **Sequential step-by-step walkthrough**
   (Used in the Weekly Meal Builder with visual guidance)

And they want to know *which one to use for Anti-Inflammatory Hub.*

Let’s cut the noise:

# ✅ **THE CORRECT CHOICE IS OPTION A + A SMALL UPGRADE**

**NOT** Option B (too heavy, new component required)
**NOT** Option C (no existing 8-step system)

## ✔ Use the **existing info modal pattern** (like Diabetes & GLP-1)

BUT…
**Upgrade it to a “sectioned modal” with headings for each step.**

Not 8 separate screens.
Not a whole new component.
Not a sequential wizard.

Instead:

* One modal
* Multiple sections
* Each section = one “step”
* Scrollable
* Headings like:

  * Step 1: Welcome
  * Step 2: How this hub works
  * Step 3: What to avoid
  * etc.

This gives you:

* **Instant consistency** with existing hubs
* **Zero new engineering**
* **Zero risk** to the rest of the app
* **Easy for users**
* **Clean for App-of-the-Year submission**
* **100% matches your other clinical hubs**

And you get everything you want (each step explained) **without forcing the architect to build a whole new guided-tour framework.**

### 📌 **PHASE 2 — Co-Pilot Integration (FINAL SPEC)**

After reviewing the current architecture across the app, here is the **exact pattern** to use for Phase 2:

### **1. Use the existing INFO MODAL system**

* Same system used in **DiabeticHub** and **GLP1Hub**
* Same “?” button
* Same auto-open on first visit (if coach mode enabled)
* Same styling, same animations
* NO new guided-tour component
* NO multi-step wizard
* NO new UI framework

### **2. The Anti-Inflammatory Hub Info Modal MUST contain the 8-step structure**

Inside one scrollable modal.

Use section headers for each step:

```
Step 1 — Welcome
Step 2 — How This Hub Works
Step 3 — What To Avoid
Step 4 — Meal Generation
Step 5 — Weekly Meal Planner
Step 6 — Meal Replacements
Step 7 — Warm Food Priority
Step 8 — You're Ready
```

### **3. Use the EXACT text provided for each step**

Do **not** rewrite or shorten.
Paste the exact 8-step script into the modal.

### **4. Modal Requirements**

* Same visual pattern as Diabetes/GLP-1
* Title: “Welcome to the Anti-Inflammatory Clinical Hub”
* Subsections for each step
* Scrollable
* Reopen with “?” button
* Auto-open on first visit (if applicable)

### **5. Co-Pilot Trigger Button**

* Use the same “?” icon button pattern as Diabetes/GLP-1 hubs
* Same placement (top right)
* No floating FAB required
* Use the same component you found in those hubs

### **6. DO NOT BUILD NEW COMPONENTS**

* No guided-tour overlays
* No sequential step engine
* No highlighting UI elements
* No step-progression logic
* Keep everything simple and consistent

### **7. Deliverables**

* Anti-Inflammatory Hub with a sectioned 8-step info modal
* Modal fully functional with “?” button
* Modal auto-open logic preserved
* No impact to Diabetes or GLP-1 hubs
* Styling identical to existing hubs
* No new framework or UI pattern introduced

# 🟣 SUMMARY (Tell them this)

**We are NOT using a multi-step guided tour.
We are using the same single-screen info modal as Diabetes/GLP-1,
but sectioned into 8 steps inside the modal.**

This is the correct, safest, fastest, and most consistent solution.

# Want me to write the **exact JSX structure** for the modal so the agent can paste it directly into the file?

I can generate a:

* Perfect modal component
* With all 8 steps formatted
* Styled to match Diabetes/GLP-1 hubs
* With headings + sections + spacing
* Exactly ready for their codebase

Just say: **“Yes, generate the modal JSX.”**
