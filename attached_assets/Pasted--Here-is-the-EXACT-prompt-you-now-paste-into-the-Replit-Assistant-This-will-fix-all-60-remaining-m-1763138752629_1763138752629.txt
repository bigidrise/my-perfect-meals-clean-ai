🔥 Here is the EXACT prompt you now paste into the Replit Assistant
This will fix all 60 remaining meals in one controlled update:

REPLIT ASSISTANT — Phase A Final Diabetic Standardization Prompt
Please finish Phase A by standardizing all remaining Diabetic meals that still use the
legacy ingredient structure.

Files and problem ranges to fix:
1. client/src/data/diabeticMenu.breakfast.ts
   - Meals at indexes 30–49 still use { item, amount }
2. client/src/data/diabeticMenu.dinner.ts
   - Meals at indexes 6–45 still use { item, amount }

Your goal:
Convert ALL legacy entries into the universal ingredient schema:

{
  name: string,
  quantity: number,
  unit: string,
  notes?: string
}

Transformation rules:
- Extract the ingredient’s core name → name
- Convert "1/2 cup" or similar → quantity: 0.5, unit: "cup"
- Units must be singular only (cup, tbsp, tsp, oz, g, ml, each)
- Quantity must be numeric only
- Move all descriptors, preparation terms, and parenthetical content into notes
- Remove all parentheses and content from the name
- No fused quantity/unit strings allowed
- No unicode fractions
- No string fractions
- Remove legacy fields (item, amount)

Match the style already used in the standardized breakfast meals (0–29),
lunch meals, and snack meals.

Deliverables:
- Update all 60 legacy meals to match the universal schema.
- Provide a diff for each updated section so I can review changes.

Important:
Do NOT modify meals that already match the new schema.
Only standardize the flagged legacy entries.


🎯 Once that is done:
You will have:
✔️ 100% standardized Diabetic Breakfast
✔️ 100% standardized Diabetic Lunch
✔️ 100% standardized Diabetic Dinner
✔️ 100% standardized Diabetic Snacks
✔️ ALL 60 legacy entries fixed
✔️ A fully universal ingredient dataset
✔️ A clean base for the GLP-1 migration
Phase A → Diabetic section is complete.

🚀 After the Diabetic fix is finished
We move to:
Next: GLP-1 standardization (very easy — almost perfect already)
