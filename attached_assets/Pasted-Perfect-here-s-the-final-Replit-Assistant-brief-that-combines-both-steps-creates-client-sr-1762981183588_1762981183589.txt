Perfect — here’s the **final Replit Assistant brief** that combines both steps:
✅ creates `client/src/data/mealIngredients.ts` (if missing),
✅ and wires the **snack picker switch logic** into the AI Meal Creator Modal so snacks use the new dataset automatically.

## 🧠 Replit Assistant Brief — Create Meal Ingredients + Wire Snack Picker Switch

### 🎯 Objective

Ensure the **AI Meal Creator Modal** dynamically switches between meal ingredients and snack ingredients depending on what type of card (meal vs snack) the user is creating.
Also confirm `client/src/data/mealIngredients.ts` exists for main meal data.

---

### 🗂 Files to Modify or Create

#### 1️⃣ Create (if missing)

**`client/src/data/mealIngredients.ts`**

Add this file with the following baseline data structure (used by all full meals):

```ts
export const mealIngredients = {
  proteins: [
    { name: "Chicken breast" },
    { name: "Turkey" },
    { name: "Lean beef" },
    { name: "Egg whites" },
    { name: "Salmon" },
    { name: "Shrimp" },
    { name: "Tuna" },
    { name: "Tempeh" },
    { name: "Tofu" },
    { name: "Cottage cheese" },
  ],
  starchyCarbs: [
    { name: "Brown rice" },
    { name: "Quinoa" },
    { name: "Sweet potato" },
    { name: "Oats" },
    { name: "Whole-wheat pasta" },
    { name: "Beans" },
    { name: "Lentils" },
    { name: "Corn" },
    { name: "Ezekiel bread" },
    { name: "Farro" },
  ],
  fibrousCarbs: [
    { name: "Broccoli" },
    { name: "Spinach" },
    { name: "Zucchini" },
    { name: "Asparagus" },
    { name: "Cauliflower" },
    { name: "Green beans" },
    { name: "Kale" },
    { name: "Brussels sprouts" },
    { name: "Bell pepper" },
    { name: "Cucumber" },
  ],
  fats: [
    { name: "Avocado" },
    { name: "Olive oil" },
    { name: "Almonds" },
    { name: "Walnuts" },
    { name: "Cashews" },
    { name: "Chia seeds" },
    { name: "Flax oil" },
    { name: "Natural peanut butter" },
    { name: "Coconut oil" },
    { name: "Pumpkin seeds" },
  ],
};
```

---

#### 2️⃣ Modify

**`client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`**

Add imports for both datasets:

```ts
import { mealIngredients } from "@/data/mealIngredients";
import { snackIngredients } from "@/data/snackIngredients";
```

Then, near the section that loads or renders ingredient categories,
add this conditional source switch:

```ts
// Determine which ingredient dataset to use
const ingredientSource =
  formData.mealType === "snack" ? snackIngredients : mealIngredients;
```

Replace any references to `mealIngredients` with `ingredientSource` when rendering categories:

```tsx
{Object.entries(ingredientSource).map(([category, items]) => (
  <CategorySection key={category} title={category} items={items} />
))}
```

---

### 🧩 Expected Behavior

✅ Breakfast/lunch/dinner use `mealIngredients`
✅ Snacks use `snackIngredients` (with Sweet, Savory, Light, Protein, Drinkables, Dessert)
✅ “Create Snack with AI” now pulls the correct ingredient set
✅ No other cards or UI are affected

---

### 🧪 Test Plan

1. Open any meal board → click “Create with AI” on **Breakfast** — see normal protein/carb/fat list.
2. Click “Create with AI” on **Snack** — see new 6 snack categories.
3. Confirm DALL·E images display for snack items.
4. Generate a snack — result includes snack-type meals (smoothies, bars, small bites).
5. Verify no console errors.

---

### 💬 Commit Message

```
feat(ai-meal-creator): wire snackIngredients dataset into AI Meal Creator and ensure mealIngredients base file exists
```

---

Once the assistant applies this, you’ll have the full AI-powered snack generator working across every board — no more chicken-and-rice snacks.
Would you like me to also add a **small caching step** next (so DALL·E doesn’t re-generate the same images repeatedly)?
