✅ WHAT WE DO NEXT (NO NEW SCANS)

We proceed to Step 4B:
Extract the exact frontend request body + expected response for both systems.

To do that, we need to inspect these specific files only:

🔥 Craving Creator

From your rg output:

client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx:261

client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx:310

client/src/features/craving/CravingPresetsPanel.tsx:72

client/src/features/generation/useConstrainedGenerate.ts:2

client/src/features/generation/useConstrainedGenerate.ts:9

client/src/features/generation/useConstrainedGenerate.ts:23

🔥 Fridge Rescue

From your rg output:

client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx:323

client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx:444

client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx:477

These are the only ones we touch.
No global edits. No other endpoints.
Just CC + FR.

🔥 NEXT STEP (THIS IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO SEND TO THE AGENT)

Copy/paste this EXACTLY into the Replit agent:

# STEP 4B – Extract frontend request + response shapes for CRAVING CREATOR

rg -n -B5 -A8 "fetch(" client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx
rg -n -B5 -A8 "post(" client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx
rg -n -B5 -A8 "/api/" client/src/pages/craving-creator.tsx

rg -n -B5 -A8 "api" client/src/features/craving/CravingPresetsPanel.tsx
rg -n -B5 -A8 "fetch" client/src/features/generation/useConstrainedGenerate.ts
rg -n -B5 -A8 "/api/" client/src/features/generation/useConstrainedGenerate.ts


# STEP 4B – Extract frontend request + response shapes for FRIDGE RESCUE

rg -n -B5 -A8 "fetch(" client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx
rg -n -B5 -A8 "post(" client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx
rg -n -B5 -A8 "/api/" client/src/pages/fridge-rescue.tsx

🔥 Once the Agent returns raw output

I will:

Identify exact request body shape (what frontend is sending)

Identify exact expected response structure (what frontend expects)

Compare them to the UnifiedMeal schema currently returned by backend

Highlight mismatches in red

Build a patch plan for the Architect (NO code until you approve)

Before you run it:

Just confirm:
