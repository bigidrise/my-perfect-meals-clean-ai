Coach — **STOP.**
The assistant is absolutely *not* understanding the boundaries, and if we don’t lock it down **right now**, it’s going to break shit you’ve already built.

I’m taking control.

I’m about to give you a **strict, bulletproof, idiot-proof Replit Agent Correction Brief** that will:

✅ Tell it EXACTLY what it should touch
❌ Tell it EXACTLY what it must NEVER touch
⚡ Put it back on the correct path
🔒 Prevent it from messing with GLP-1 or Diabetic meal logic
🛑 Stop it from “validating snack boards” or altering UI it doesn’t understand

This brief will reset the agent mentally and get it 100% aligned with **your** system.

---

# 🚨 **REPLIT AGENT RESET BRIEF — READ THIS BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING**

**YOU MUST NOT TOUCH ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE WORK WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW.**

Here is the full correction brief to send to the agent:

---

## 🔥 **REPLIT AGENT — STOP AND READ CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES**

### ❌ DO NOT TOUCH THESE SYSTEMS:

* GLP-1 Medical Hub
* GLP-1 Meal Builder
* GLP-1 Snack Cards
* Diabetic Hub
* Diabetic Meal Builder
* Diabetic Snack Cards
* Weekly Meal Board snack cards
* ANY existing snack card logic
* ANY existing Create With AI logic except for ingredient datasets
* ANY “snack board consistency”
* ANY “six snack categories validation”
* ANY macros logic
* ANY medical guardrails logic
* ANY GLP-1 or Diabetic-specific logic

These systems are COMPLETE and WORKING.
Changing them will BREAK the app.

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU **ARE** SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

### The ONLY job right now:

### **1. Wire the NEW diet-based meal ingredient datasets**

We created new diet ingredient files:

```
ingredientsPaleo.ts
ingredientsKeto.ts
ingredientsMediterranean.ts
ingredientsGLP1.ts
ingredientsDiabetic.ts
```

These files are **already correct**.

You must **ONLY**:

### ✔️ Confirm they are imported properly

### ✔️ Confirm they are passed into the dietType system

### ✔️ Confirm they show up in AIMealCreatorModal when dietType changes

### ✔️ Confirm Create With AI uses the correct dataset

That’s it.

---

## 🚫 WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

### DO NOT:

* Modify snacks
* Modify snack boards
* Modify snack logic
* Rebuild the snack categories
* Alter snack ingredient lists
* Add or remove snack categories
* Adjust snack picker UI
* Adjust snack card UI
* Touch ANY snack UI on GLP-1 or Diabetic or Weekly boards

THE SNACK SYSTEM IS DONE.
IT IS NOT TO BE CHANGED.

---

## 🔥 WHAT **NEEDS FIXING RIGHT NOW**

Three meal boards still pass `"snack"` instead of `"snacks"`:

* WeeklyMealBoard
* GLP1 Meal Builder
* Diabetic Meal Builder

This causes them to load MEAL ingredients instead of snack ingredients.

### ✔️ Fix only this:

Change:

```ts
setAiMealSlot("snack")
```

to:

```ts
setAiMealSlot("snacks")
```

in all three files.

### ❗ NOTHING ELSE SHOULD CHANGE IN THOSE FILES.

---

## 📌 SUMMARY OF YOUR CURRENT MISSION

### **Your task:**

**ONLY** wire and validate diet meal ingredient datasets
**ONLY** fix the `"snack"` → `"snacks"` mismatch in 3 files

### **Do NOT:**

Modify snack system
Touch GLP-1
Touch Diabetic
Touch Weekly Snack Card
Touch existing Create With AI logic
Touch macros
Touch guardrails
Touch medical presets

---

## 🧠 If you're unsure — STOP and ask.

---

Coach, THIS is the brief you give to the Replit agent.
This will put the guardrails back on that thing.

If you want, I can also add:

✅ automated checks
or
⚠️ lock certain directories so the agent won’t touch them

Just say the word.
