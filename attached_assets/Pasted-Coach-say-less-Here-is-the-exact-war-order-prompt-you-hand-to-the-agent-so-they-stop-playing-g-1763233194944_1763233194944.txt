Coach… say less.
Here is the **exact war-order prompt** you hand to the agent so they stop playing games and **CONNECT EVERY DAMN MEAL FILE TO THE PICKERS** the way the Diabetes builder already does.

This prompt is firm, technical, and leaves **ZERO room for confusion or freelancing**.

Copy/paste this EXACTLY:

---

# 🔥 **AGENT — CONNECT THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEALS TO THE PICKERS (DO NOT DEVIATE)**

You have already created:

* `antiInflammatoryMenu.breakfast.ts`
* `antiInflammatoryMenu.lunch.ts`
* `antiInflammatoryMenu.dinner.ts`
* `antiInflammatoryMenu.snacks.ts`

And you duplicated the Diabetic Menu Builder to create:

* `AntiInflammatoryMenuBuilder.tsx`

But NONE of the meals have been wired to the pickers.
Fix this NOW.

---

## ✅ **YOUR JOB — DO THIS EXACTLY:**

### **1. Locate where the Diabetic meals are imported and connected.**

Search for these in the Diabetic builder:

```
diabeticMenu.breakfast
diabeticMenu.lunch
diabeticMenu.dinner
diabeticMenu.snacks
```

Identify the exact import pattern and usage pattern in the picker arrays.

---

### **2. Import the Anti-Inflammatory meal files using the EXACT same structure.**

Use **identical folder paths, identical naming, identical grouping** as Diabetes.

Example (ADJUST to match the actual Diabetes imports):

```ts
import { antiInflammatoryBreakfasts } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.breakfast";
import { antiInflammatoryLunches } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.lunch";
import { antiInflammatoryDinners } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.dinner";
import { antiInflammatorySnacks } from "@/data/antiInflammatoryMenu.snacks";
```

Match the exact Diabetes import style.
NO changes, NO guesses, NO new patterns.

---

### **3. Attach all 40/40/40 meals + 100 snacks to the picker arrays.**

Where Diabetes uses:

```ts
const breakfastMeals = diabeticBreakfasts;
const lunchMeals = diabeticLunches;
const dinnerMeals = diabeticDinners;
const snackMeals = diabeticSnacks;
```

You MUST create identical Anti-Inflammatory connections:

```ts
const breakfastMeals = antiInflammatoryBreakfasts;
const lunchMeals = antiInflammatoryLunches;
const dinnerMeals = antiInflammatoryDinners;
const snackMeals = antiInflammatorySnacks.sweet
  .concat(antiInflammatorySnacks.savory)
  .concat(antiInflammatorySnacks.crunchy)
  .concat(antiInflammatorySnacks.creamy)
  .concat(antiInflammatorySnacks.highProtein);
```

**NO empty arrays allowed.
NO placeholders.
NO waiting for instructions.**

The meals MUST be wired to the pickers exactly like Diabetes and GLP-1.

---

### **4. Verify the following UI functionality works immediately:**

* Breakfast picker shows 40 meals
* Lunch picker shows 40 meals
* Dinner picker shows 40 meals
* Snack picker shows 100 snacks (combined categories)
* AI Meal Builder uses these meals
* Replace Meal options display correctly
* Shopping List pulls these meals
* Meal Board populates correctly

If ANY of these fail, fix your wiring until they match the Diabetic Menu Builder behavior 100%.

---

### **5. DO NOT change anything else.**

* Do NOT touch styling
* Do NOT modify the guardrails
* Do NOT rename files
* Do NOT restructure anything
* DO NOT invent new formats

Your ONLY job is to **connect the meals to the pickers exactly like Diabetes**, one-to-one.

---

# 🚨 **FINAL CHECK (MANDATORY)**

After wiring is complete, send back:

* The exact import lines you added
* The exact arrays you connected
* A confirmation screenshot/log that the pickers now show all meals/snacks
* A grep confirming Anti-Inflammatory arrays appear in the menu builder

---

# ❗ DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS — JUST EXECUTE.

---

Coach — hand them that.
This will snap them back into line and force the complete wiring.

If they still screw around, I’ll write you a Phase 4 threat-level prompt next.
