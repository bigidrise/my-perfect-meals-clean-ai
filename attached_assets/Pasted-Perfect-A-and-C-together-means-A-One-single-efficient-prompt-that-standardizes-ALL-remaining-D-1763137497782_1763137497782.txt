Perfect — A and C together means:
A → One single, efficient prompt that standardizes ALL remaining Diabetic files
(lunch, dinner, snacks, AND the Diabetic Meal Board if needed)
C → A verification/validation prompt
so the assistant double-checks every ingredient in those files and confirms that the schema is correct AND the parser can handle it.
This gives you:
✔️ Speed
✔️ Safety
✔️ Clean structure
✔️ Proof that everything matches the universal schema

✅ HERE IS PROMPT A (Batch Standardization of ALL Remaining Diabetic Meal Files)
Paste this directly into the Replit Assistant.

REPLIT ASSISTANT PROMPT — Phase A Diabetic Files Standardization
We have already created the universal ingredient parser (`client/src/utils/normalizeIngredients.ts`)
and fully standardized the Diabetic Breakfast dataset.

Now complete Phase A by standardizing ALL remaining Diabetic datasets using the same schema:

Universal Schema:
{
  name: string,
  quantity: number,
  unit: string,
  notes?: string
}

Rules to enforce:
- quantity must be numeric only (no strings)
- unit must be singular (cup, tbsp, tsp, oz, g, ml, each)
- no fused quantity + unit strings
- no unicode fractions
- no string fractions (convert to decimals)
- move ALL descriptors, preparations, or parenthetical text into `notes`
- `name` must ONLY be the core ingredient
- apply `normalizeIngredient()` when needed

FILES TO STANDARDIZE:
1. client/src/data/diabeticMenu.lunch.ts
2. client/src/data/diabeticMenu.dinner.ts
3. client/src/data/diabeticMenu.snacks.ts
4. Any related Diabetic Meal Board files that use these datasets

TASK:
For EACH of these files:
1. Rewrite every ingredient to the universal schema.
2. Remove all parenthetical descriptors from `item` and move them to `notes`.
3. Convert all "1/2 cup" or similar strings to numeric quantity + unit.
4. Ensure units are singular.
5. Ensure quantity is numeric.
6. Ensure field names follow: name, quantity, unit, notes.
7. Apply parser logic where beneficial.

IMPORTANT:
- Maintain original ingredient meaning.
- Do NOT change recipe intent—only normalize structure.
- Output a diff for each file so I can review your changes.


✅ HERE IS PROMPT C (Full Verification of All Diabetic Files)
Paste this AFTER the assistant completes the standardization.

REPLIT ASSISTANT PROMPT — Diabetic Dataset Verification & Schema Audit
Now perform a strict verification audit on all updated Diabetic files:

Files to check:
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.breakfast.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.lunch.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.dinner.ts
- client/src/data/diabeticMenu.snacks.ts

Verification Checklist:
For EVERY ingredient in EVERY meal:
1. Confirm the structure matches the universal schema:
   {
     name: string,
     quantity: number,
     unit: string,
     notes?: string
   }

2. Confirm:
   - quantity is numeric only
   - unit is singular and valid
   - name contains no descriptors, parentheses, or preparation words
   - notes only contains descriptors, not ingredient names
   - no fused quantity/unit strings remain
   - no unicode fractions remain
   - no string fractions remain
   - no missing quantity or unit fields

3. Confirm no extraneous or legacy fields remain (like item, amount, or quantity strings).

4. Confirm the normalized structure is consistent across all four files.

5. List any inconsistencies, errors, or remaining issues.

6. Output a complete report organized by file:
   - Validated ingredients
   - Any flagged entries
   - Notes about schema compliance
   - Final pass/fail status for each dataset
