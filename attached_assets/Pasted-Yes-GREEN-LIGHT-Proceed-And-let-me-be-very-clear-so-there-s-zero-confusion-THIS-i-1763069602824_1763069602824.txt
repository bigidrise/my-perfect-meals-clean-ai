Yes — **GREEN LIGHT. Proceed.**

And let me be very clear so there’s zero confusion:

### ✅ **THIS is EXACTLY what you should do next (and ONLY this):**

The assistant should **finish Phase 5 wiring** on the two new boards:

* **LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx**
* **ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx**

Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

# 🔧 **What the assistant must now implement (Phase 5 completion)**

### **1. Render MealIngredientPicker when a diet is selected**

Right now, both boards show placeholders — you need to replace the placeholder with:

```tsx
<MealIngredientPicker
    dietConfig={DIET_CONFIG_FOR_SELECTED_DIET}
    dietType={selectedDiet}
/>
```

Where:

* `DIET_CONFIG_FOR_SELECTED_DIET` = lifestyleDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet] OR clinicalDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet]

This MUST be wired properly.

---

### **2. Show "Choose a diet to continue" when no diet is selected**

This message should appear:

* In the meal cards area, **instead** of the picker
* In the modal if user tries to add a meal without choosing a diet

---

### **3. Pass correct props to MealIngredientPicker**

This is mandatory:

```tsx
dietConfig={lifestyleDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet]}
dietType={selectedDiet}
```

or for clinical:

```tsx
dietConfig={clinicalDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet]}
dietType={selectedDiet}
```

---

### **4. The AI meal-generation request must include:**

* `dietType`
* ingredients from the selected diet (mealIngredientPicker already handles this)

DO NOT change the backend.
Simply ensure the frontend request body includes:

```ts
dietType: selectedDiet
```

---

### ✔️ What the assistant must NOT touch:

🚫 No backend
🚫 No database
🚫 No schemas
🚫 No guardrails
🚫 No presets
🚫 No other boards
🚫 No snack-card logic

Only finish the wiring.

---

# 🔥 **SEND THIS BACK TO THE REPLIT ASSISTANT AS YOUR RESPONSE**

---

# 📌 **Proceed with Phase 5 Completion**

You may now implement the missing Phase 5 wiring. Do the following ONLY:

### **1. Render MealIngredientPicker when a diet is selected**

In both:

* `LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`
* `ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx`

Replace the placeholder UI with:

```tsx
<MealIngredientPicker
  dietConfig={lifestyleDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet] || clinicalDietPickerConfig[selectedDiet]}
  dietType={selectedDiet}
/>
```

depending on the file.

### **2. Show “Choose a diet to continue” when no diet is selected**

Render a clean placeholder message instead of the picker.

### **3. Ensure AI requests include dietType**

Add `dietType` into the request body on generate.

### **4. Do NOT modify anything outside Phase 5**

No backend.
No guardrails.
No database.
No additional features.

---

# 🏁 **Goal**

Make both new boards fully functional with **diet-specific ingredient pickers**, identical to how the existing boards work — but filtered by diet.

---

Send that to the assistant *exactly as-is*, Coach.

Then send me their response and I’ll keep them aligned.
