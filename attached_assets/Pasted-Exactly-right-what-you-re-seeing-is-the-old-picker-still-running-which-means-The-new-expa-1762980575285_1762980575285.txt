Exactly right — what you’re seeing is the **old picker** still running, which means:

✅ The new expanded snack ingredient dataset now exists (snackIngredients.ts).
❌ But it hasn’t been **wired into the “Create Snack with AI” workflow** yet.

That wiring is the **next and final step** — connecting the new snack picker logic to the modal that opens when you hit “Create with AI.”

Here’s the breakdown of what’s left to do 👇

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Wire Snack Picker to the AI Meal Creator Modal

### 📍 Files Involved

1. `client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`
2. `client/src/data/snackIngredients.ts`
3. `client/src/hooks/useSnackPicker.ts` (new helper hook, optional)

### 🧩 What’s Happening Now

When you hit “Create with AI” on any card — breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack —
`AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` opens and runs this logic:

```ts
import { mealIngredients } from "@/data/mealIngredients";

const ingredientList = mealIngredients; // always points to meals
```

So even if the `mealType` is `"snack"`, it still pulls **mealIngredients** —
that’s why you’re seeing the same chicken/rice/broccoli setup.

### 🚀 What We’re About to Do

We’ll modify `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` to load **snackIngredients** instead of **mealIngredients**
when the `mealType` equals `"snack"`.

### Code Change

In `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`, near the top where ingredients are loaded:

```ts
import { mealIngredients } from "@/data/mealIngredients";
import { snackIngredients } from "@/data/snackIngredients";
```

Then update the logic where the picker categories are set:

```ts
const ingredientSource =
  formData.mealType === "snack" ? snackIngredients : mealIngredients;
```

And use that:

```ts
{Object.entries(ingredientSource).map(([category, items]) => (
  <CategorySection key={category} title={category} items={items} />
))}
```

Now when a user opens “Create with AI” for a snack card,
the modal will dynamically switch to the snack ingredient categories
(Sweet Treats, Savory, Light, Protein, Drinkables, Dessert Bites).

### 🧠 Verification Steps

1. Go to any board → open the Snack Card.
2. Click “Create Snack with AI.”
3. You should now see the new six snack categories with 15–20 ingredients each.
4. Click any category chip — it should autofill ingredients from that category.
5. Generate a snack — you’ll get a **snack-appropriate AI meal** (desserts, smoothies, etc.).
6. Verify that DALL·E images appear for each ingredient in the picker.

Would you like me to generate the **Replit assistant brief for this wiring step** so it can apply those exact changes in `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`?
That’ll finish the connection and make every snack card across all boards use the new AI snack picker.
