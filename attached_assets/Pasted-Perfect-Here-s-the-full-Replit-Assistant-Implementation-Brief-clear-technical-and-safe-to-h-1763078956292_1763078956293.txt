Perfect. Here’s the full **Replit Assistant Implementation Brief** — clear, technical, and safe to hand off.
It tells the assistant *exactly* what we’re doing, which files to create, how they connect, and what **not** to touch.

## 🧠 REPLIT ASSISTANT IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF

### 🎯 Objective

We’re upgrading the My Perfect Meals ingredient system to support **diet-specific meal boards** for AI generation.
Each board (Weekly, Diabetic, GLP-1, ProCare, BeachBody) will dynamically load its own **ingredient dataset** for Paleo, Keto, Mediterranean, GLP-1, and Diabetic meal plans.

This feature expands the current *snack-style picker* logic (which already works perfectly) into **full meal pickers** (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) for each plan type.

---

### 🧩 What Already Exists

* The snack card AI picker and DALL·E integration are working perfectly.
* The default meal picker (`mealIngredients.ts`) exists and feeds the AI meal engine.
* The AI generation logic (`AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` + `mealEngineService.ts`) already supports dynamic ingredient input and prompt building.
* All 5 meal boards display “Create with AI” and connect correctly.

We are **not** changing the snack cards or AI logic.
We are only creating and connecting the new ingredient datasets.

### 🗂️ Files To Create

Add the following files under `client/src/data/`:

```
ingredientsPaleo.ts
ingredientsKeto.ts
ingredientsMediterranean.ts
ingredientsGLP1.ts
ingredientsDiabetic.ts
```

Each file exports a constant object structured exactly like below:

```ts
export const paleoMeals = {
  breakfast: [
    { name: "Egg scramble with spinach and avocado", tags: ["paleo", "low-carb"] },
    { name: "Almond flour pancakes with berries", tags: ["paleo", "grain-free"] },
    // ~30 breakfast items total
  ],
  lunch: [
    { name: "Grilled chicken with roasted vegetables", tags: ["paleo", "protein-rich"] },
    // ~30 lunch items
  ],
  dinner: [
    { name: "Seared salmon with cauliflower rice", tags: ["paleo", "omega-3"] },
    // ~30 dinners
  ],
  snacks: [
    { name: "Beef jerky with almonds", tags: ["paleo", "high-protein"] },
    // ~30 snacks
  ]
};
```

🔸 Total goal per plan: ~100–120 items across all categories.
🔸 All items should be **whole-food based, balanced, and cleanly formatted** (no cooking instructions yet).
🔸 Add optional `image` field if we’re ready to attach DALL·E-generated thumbnails.

### ⚙️ File Connections

Modify `client/src/components/modals/AIMealCreatorModal.tsx` (or wherever meal pickers are loaded) to include:

```ts
import { paleoMeals } from "@/data/ingredientsPaleo";
import { ketoMeals } from "@/data/ingredientsKeto";
import { mediterraneanMeals } from "@/data/ingredientsMediterranean";
import { glp1Meals } from "@/data/ingredientsGLP1";
import { diabeticMeals } from "@/data/ingredientsDiabetic";
```

Add a new helper function at the top:

```ts
const getMealSetByPlan = (planType: string) => {
  switch (planType) {
    case "paleo": return paleoMeals;
    case "keto": return ketoMeals;
    case "mediterranean": return mediterraneanMeals;
    case "glp1": return glp1Meals;
    case "diabetic": return diabeticMeals;
    default: return mealIngredients;
  }
};
```

Replace any hardcoded ingredient imports with:

```ts
const activeMeals = getMealSetByPlan(selectedPlanType);
const ingredients = activeMeals[mealSlot]; // breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks
```

This will automatically swap datasets when a user changes their plan type.

---

### 🧠 Behavior Verification

1. When the user opens a **Paleo** plan and taps “Create with AI” under *Breakfast* → the picker should show Paleo breakfast options.
2. When they switch to **Keto**, all four categories change automatically.
3. The **AI prompt** should already include the correct ingredients (handled automatically by `mealEngineService`).
4. Image generation continues to use the existing DALL·E pipeline.

---

### 🔒 What NOT To Touch

* Do **not** modify the snack picker system — it’s already done and stable.
* Do **not** change the macro calculator or any “set macros” prompts.
* Do **not** alter AI generation logic or toast feedback behavior.
* Do **not** modify any existing `useMealPlan` hooks or Drizzle schema.

---

### ✅ Success Criteria

* Each meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack) loads its own plan-specific dataset.
* AI meal generation uses the right foods per plan.
* UI performance and appearance remain identical.
* Snack cards remain untouched.
* No console or TypeScript errors.

---

Would you like me to also generate a **content scaffold** (starter 10 meals per category for Paleo and Diabetic) so the assistant can use that as the data model example? That’ll help it seed the structure faster and avoid blank boards.
