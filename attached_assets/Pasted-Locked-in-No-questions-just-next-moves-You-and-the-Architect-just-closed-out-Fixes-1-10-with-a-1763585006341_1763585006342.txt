Locked in. No questions, just next moves.

You and the Architect just closed out Fixes 1–10 with a full production sign-off. That means the **generation spine is done**. Now the only smart move is to hammer it with testing and hunt down any **real** failures instead of guessing.

Here’s exactly what to do next.

## 🔥 STEP 1 — In-App Sanity Pass For All 7 Generators

Run these like a checklist. If any one of these flows breaks, that’s when we do a **surgical** patch, not another global refactor.

### 1) Craving Creator

* Open Craving Creator
* Type a craving that would have broken before (example: “ice cream sandwich”)
* Set servings to 1–2
* Choose any diet filter
* Generate
* Confirm:

  * A meal card appears
  * Ingredients list is filled, not `undefined`
  * Instructions show steps, not empty
  * Calories/macros appear or show as null but do not crash

### 2) Fridge Rescue

Test all three paths, since they were the messiest.

* Main generate input using comma list
* Quick replace button
* Local list replace path

For each:

* Enter a few ingredients
* Hit generate or replace
* Confirm meal cards render with ingredients and instructions

### 3) AI Meal Creator

* Open AI Meal Creator modal
* Set a goal, macros, preferences, and excluded ingredients
* Generate
* Confirm the created meal flows correctly into:

  * Its card
  * Any “Add to board” or “Use this meal” flows
  * No crashes around ingredients or macros

### 4) Meal Finder

* Open Meal Finder
* Use:

  * A basic text search
  * A search with category filters
  * A search with calorie range
* Confirm results list appears and all meal cards render cleanly

### 5) Restaurant Guide

* Open Restaurant Guide
* Select a restaurant and dish scenario
* Generate a recommendation
* Confirm:

  * A single meal shows
  * Ingredients and instructions render
  * No `undefined` labels on the card

### 6) Premades

* Open any premade category that uses MealPremadePicker (kids, cravings, etc)
* Select multiple premades
* Confirm:

  * Cards render
  * Ingredients display correctly
  * Any links to shopping list still work

### 7) Weekly Meal Board

* From any generator (Craving, Fridge, AI), add a meal to the Weekly Meal Board
* Open the Weekly Meal Board
* Confirm:

  * The card shows the correct name
  * Ingredients and macros appear
  * Any “replace this meal” flow still works

## 🔧 STEP 2 — Quick Code Audit For Any Leftover Legacy Keys

This is a **read-only** safety sweep. No edits, no refactors. Just making sure nothing important is still bypassing the new normalizer.

Hand this to the Agent:

```bash
# Scan for legacy payload keys that should now be normalized
rg -n "craving:" client/src || true
rg -n "dietaryRestrictions" client/src || true
rg -n "fridgeItems" client/src || true
rg -n "ingredients:" client/src/pages client/src/features || true
rg -n "macros\." client/src || true

# Scan for direct usage of backend UnifiedMeal fields that should be normalized at the edge
rg -n "meal\.title" client/src || true
rg -n "meal\.macros" client/src || true
rg -n "ounces" client/src || true
```

Anything still doing its own mapping to or from `title`, `fridgeItems`, `dietaryRestrictions`, or `meal.macros` outside the normalizer or `mealViewAdapter` is a candidate for a **tiny, targeted** fix next.

## ⚠️ STEP 3 — Ignore the Cron “plan column” Error For Now

That cron log about `column "plan" does not exist` is a **backend reminder system issue**, not part of this frontend normalization work.

It does not block:

* Craving Creator
* Fridge Rescue
* AI Meal Creator
* Meal Finder
* Restaurant Guide
* Premades
* Weekly Meal Board

That gets handled in a separate backend pass when you are ready to let the Architect touch server code.

## 🎯 Where You Stand Right Now

* UnifiedMeal end-to-end pipeline: **Live and verified**
* Seven generator surfaces: **Normalized and wired to shared logic**
* Backward compatibility: **Protected** with `name` and `item`
* UI adapters: **Centralized** in `mealViewAdapter.ts`
* Code bloat: **Reduced** by ~57 lines of duplicated junk

Next logical step is simple:

* Run the in-app tests above
* Let real behavior tell us where to strike next

Whenever you see a specific break or weird behavior, drop the raw error or stack trace and file path, and we go straight into precision repair mode.
