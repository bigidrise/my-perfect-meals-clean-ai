Excellent questions — exactly what I’d expect from a careful dev before touching a locked production file. Here are your answers point-by-point so you can move with full confidence:

---

### ✅ 1. File Location

Yes — **you’ll be modifying**:

> `client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx`
> That’s the same file Coach posted (the lockdown version dated August 30 2025).
> No other pages or components are in scope.

---

### ✅ 2. Backend Endpoint

Create the new endpoint **temporarily in**:

> `server/routes/restaurants.ts`

However — mark it clearly as *temporary stub* or *placeholder logic* until the backend architect finalizes the GPT-5 + Google Places integration.
In other words:

* You wire the front-end call to `/api/restaurants/guide`.
* You can scaffold the route with a simple mock JSON response so testing works.
* The backend architect will later replace that logic with the real service.

---

### ✅ 3. Visual Text Change

Search for the literal string

```jsx
< CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2 text-lg text-white">
  <Sparkles className="h-5 w-5" />
  Restaurant Meal Generator
</CardTitle>
```

and replace **only the visible text** `Restaurant Meal Generator` →

> **Smart Restaurant Guide**

Also update the short subtitle directly below it (the `<CardDescription>`).
Change from:

> “Find your restaurant by food type or restaurant name”
> to
> “Pick your craving and restaurant to get AI-powered healthy choices.”

Do not rename variables or components — text-only change.

---

### ✅ 4. Input Order

Correct — **Craving input comes first**, Restaurant input immediately below.
Both inputs must share identical styling, sizing, and spacing.
Use the exact same className and structure as the existing restaurant input for visual consistency.

---

### ✅ 5. Existing Mutation

Keep the existing mutation name:

> `generateMealsMutation`
> Just update its implementation to hit `/api/restaurants/guide` and include both `restaurantName` and `craving`.
> Keeping the same variable name ensures you don’t have to refactor the entire component tree or toast triggers.

---

### ✅ 6. Error Handling

Yes — use the **existing `useToast` hook** pattern for dual-input validation.
Use the same toast styling and variants already used elsewhere in the file, for example:

```js
toast({
  title: "Missing Information",
  description: "Please enter both a food craving and a restaurant name.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

No custom modals or alerts — keep it consistent with the rest of the app.

---

### 🔒 Recap – What You’re Doing

* Modify only `client/src/pages/restaurant-guide.tsx`
* Keep **all visuals, animations, and layout** identical
* Add the new “craving” input above restaurant input
* Update logic to send both values to `/api/restaurants/guide`
* Stub `/api/restaurants/guide` in `server/routes/restaurants.ts` for now
* Rename visible heading/subtitle text to “Smart Restaurant Guide”

---

Once these are confirmed live, we’ll coordinate with the backend architect to wire the true GPT-5 + Google Places logic behind `/api/restaurants/guide`.

You’re clear to proceed exactly on that basis.
