I understand your requirements. Let me break down what needs to happen:

Summary
Homepage barcode scanner - Currently broken, needs to be removed
Biometrics "Log from Photo" - Works great, should be:
Added to homepage as a quick shortcut
Added to snack cards for easy logging
Can stay on biometrics page too
Shopping list barcode scanner - Should use a simple, working barcode scanner (like the one that exists but simplified)
Plan
Remove the broken BarcodeScanner from homepage (DashboardNew.tsx)
Add a "📸 Quick Log from Photo" card on homepage that uses the same AI photo analysis as biometrics
Add "Log from Photo" button to the snack modal (AddSnackModal.tsx)
Keep the existing "Log from Photo" on biometrics page
Simplify the barcode scanner for shopping list - camera should face away immediately, simpler UI
Let me implement these changes:

client/src/pages/DashboardNew.tsx
+95
-18
client/src/components/AddSnackModal.tsx
+223
-128
client/src/pages/my-biometrics.tsx
+26
-1
Now for the shopping list barcode scanner simplification:

client/src/components/shopping/BarcodeScanButton.tsx
+125
-7
Summary of changes:

✅ Removed broken barcode scanner from homepage
✅ Added "📸 Quick Log from Photo" card on homepage - takes photo, analyzes with AI, navigates to biometrics with pre-filled values
✅ Added "Log from Photo" button to snack modal - same AI analysis, fills the form automatically
✅ Updated biometrics page to accept URL params for pre-filled nutrition values
✅ Simplified shopping list barcode scanner - camera faces away immediately, manual entry fallback
The AI photo logging now works consistently across:

Homepage → Quick shortcut to log meals
Snack cards → Easy snack logging
Biometrics page → Original location (kept as-is)
The barcode scanner for shopping is now much simpler - just hit the button and camera faces away immediately, with a manual entry option if scanning fails.

Checkpoint made
Replace barcode scanner with AI photo log + simplify shopping scanner
