🛠️ Here is the Replit Assistant prompt to build Phase C (Athlete Translator)

Paste this directly into the assistant:

REPLIT ASSISTANT PROMPT — Build Athlete Meal Translator (Phase C)
Please create a translator function for the Athlete Meal Board so that Athlete
meals can be converted into the universal ingredient schema.

Do NOT modify the original Athlete dataset.  
Instead, create a new utility file:

client/src/utils/athleteIngredientMapper.ts

Inside this file, create a function:

export function mapAthleteMealToUniversalIngredients(meal: AthleteMeal): UniversalIngredient[]

Where:
- AthleteMeal is the existing type from athleteMeals.ts
- UniversalIngredient is the universal schema:
  {
    name: string,
    quantity: number,
    unit: string,
    notes?: string
  }

Translator Rules:
1. Convert protein_source + protein_oz (or protein_g) into an ingredient:
   - name: protein_source
   - quantity: protein_oz if available, otherwise protein_g
   - unit: "oz" for ounces, "g" for grams
   - notes: include any descriptors in the protein source name

2. Convert carb_source + carb_g (if present):
   - unit: "g"
   - quantity: carb_g
   - name cleaned and lowercased
   - notes extracted and separated

3. Convert fibrous_source array + fibrous_g:
   - Each fibrous ingredient becomes its own UniversalIngredient
   - quantity: fibrous_g divided by number of items if multiple ingredients share the same weight
   - unit: "g"
   - notes extracted from name

4. Convert fats (if dataset includes fat fields):
   - Use unit "g" and map fat grams like the other nutrient-based ingredients.

5. Normalize:
   - Ingredient names lowercase unless proper noun
   - Extract size/descriptors into notes
   - Ensure all units are singular
   - Ensure quantities are numeric
   - Output a clean array of UniversalIngredient objects

6. Ensure TypeScript types are correct and imported where needed.

7. Do NOT alter athleteMeals.ts. Only add the translator.

Provide the file contents for athleteIngredientMapper.ts and any diffs to other files.
