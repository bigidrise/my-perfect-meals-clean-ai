That’s a really good comparison — and you’re looking at this the right way.
Let’s step back and look at **what’s actually happening and what’s best for consistency and brand feel**.

---

## 🎨 Brand reality check

You already **have a clear visual identity**:

* **Orange → black gradient** as the app’s accent,
* **Minimal, glass-style cards**,
* **Clean Lucide line icons** (no bulky disks or badges).

When you added the `BrandTileIcon` disk, it fixed a temporary color-inheritance bug but introduced a new *style language* (solid disks) that clashes with the rest of your flat-glass aesthetic.

---

## ✅ Best choice: Go back to your original icon style

**→ Remove the `BrandTileIcon` wrapper** everywhere.
Return to the **plain Lucide icons** with a `text-orange-400` or `text-gradient` utility, exactly as used on the Lifestyle (EmotionAIHub) page.

Then, instead of wrapping icons, we’ll just **protect them from the coach-mode color leak** with two simple rules.

---

### 1.  Lock icon colors globally

In your main CSS (globals.css or Tailwind config):

```css
/* Prevent guided flash or parent color utilities from recoloring icons */
.icon-orange path,
.icon-orange circle,
.icon-orange line,
.icon-orange polyline {
  stroke: #fb923c; /* tailwind orange-400 */
}
```

Now any icon you mark with `className="icon-orange h-6 w-6"` will *always* stay that orange, even if a parent container flashes green or white.

---

### 2.  Restore icons on the Home (DashboardNew) page

In `DashboardNew.tsx`, revert to this style:

```tsx
<MacroCalculator className="icon-orange h-10 w-10" />
<MyBiometrics className="icon-orange h-10 w-10" />
<GetInspiration className="icon-orange h-10 w-10" />
```

Remove every `<BrandTileIcon>` wrapper.

---

### 3.  Keep Lifestyle (EmotionAIHub) exactly as it is

Those icons were already correct:

```tsx
<Brain className="icon-orange h-5 w-5" />
<Utensils className="icon-orange h-5 w-5" />
```

---

### 4.  Keep Coach-Mode flashes box-shadow-only

Verify your guided animation CSS has **no text color utilities**; use outlines and rings only:

```css
.flash-green, .flash-green-strong {
  animation: pulseGreen 1.1s infinite;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px 6px rgba(16,185,129,0.3);
}
```

That way, nothing will ever override icon color again.

---

### 5.  Delete the `BrandTileIcon.tsx` component (optional)

Once all pages use `icon-orange` and are locked with CSS, you can safely delete the wrapper.
If you prefer to keep it for future experiments, just don’t use it in production for now.

### 🧾 Summary

| Option                      | Description                                                         | Result                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **A. Remove BrandTileIcon** | Restore plain Lucide icons, use `text-orange-400` or `.icon-orange` | ✅ Matches Lifestyle, consistent brand look |
| **B. Keep BrandTileIcon**   | White icons on gradient disks                                       | ❌ Heavier look, breaks brand consistency   |

→ **Use Option A** (return to plain icons).
It keeps your Emotion AI / glassmorphic aesthetic intact, looks clean across every page, and solves the unwanted green inheritance permanently.

If you’d like, I can hand you the cleaned-up `DashboardNew.tsx` with those icon fixes already applied (ready to paste). Would you like me to do that next?
