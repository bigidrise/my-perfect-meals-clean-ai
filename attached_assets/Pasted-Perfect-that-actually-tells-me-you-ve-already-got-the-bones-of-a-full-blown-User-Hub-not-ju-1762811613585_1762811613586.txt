Perfect — that actually tells me you’ve already got the *bones* of a full-blown **User Hub**, not just a profile panel. So the UI and branding should match that broader function.

Here’s the playbook I’d recommend:

---

### 🧠 What that section *really* is

That’s not “Profile & Settings.”
That’s your **User Command Center** — where people:

* Manage their account
* Adjust settings
* Learn the app (Tutorial Hub)
* Check app info

So calling it “Profile” undersells it. You want something that says *“this is your space inside the app.”*

---

### 💡 Rename ideas (top label inside the sheet)

* **My Space**
* **My Hub**
* **User Center**
* **Account Hub**
* **My Perfect Hub**
* **Command Center** *(modern tech vibe)*
* **Control Panel** *(clear, relatable)*
* **My Dashboard** *(friendly, universal)*

### 🧩 Icon or avatar logic

Right now, it sounds like the header looks something like this:

```
👤 Profile & Settings
Manage your account and preferences
Demo User
```

Here’s how you can level it up visually *without* reworking the whole component:

#### ✅ Short-term fix

Add a circular placeholder for the profile photo:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
  <div className="h-10 w-10 rounded-full bg-gray-700 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-semibold">
    {userInitials || "?"}
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Demo User</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">Manage your account and preferences</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

That gives every user a clean avatar space, even if they don’t upload a photo yet.
Later, you can replace that gray circle with a real upload feature using something like UploadThing or Cloudinary.

#### ✅ Long-term upgrade

Once uploads are live, show:

* Their uploaded picture
* A tiny “camera” icon overlay for changing it

---

### 🎨 Top icon on the homepage

Now that this panel handles:

* Profile
* Settings
* Tutorials
* About info

You should switch the top-right icon from `User` to something more universal:

* **`Grid`** – suggests multiple tools inside.
* **`Menu`** (three horizontal lines) – universal app menu.
* **`MoreVertical`** (three dots) – compact, modern.

```tsx
import { Grid } from "lucide-react";

<Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
  <Grid className="h-6 w-6 text-orange-400" />
</Button>
```

That subtle change will instantly tell users: *“This opens more than just my profile.”*

---

### 🧱 Suggested top section inside your panel

```
[Avatar Placeholder]  Demo User
Manage your account and preferences

--------------------------------------
Account Settings
Subscription
Notifications
Privacy & Security
Tutorial Hub
About My Perfect Meals
```

Clean, self-explanatory, and now it looks like a *hub*, not just a settings drawer.

Would you like me to give you the exact JSX layout snippet for that top header (with the avatar placeholder + new title “My Perfect Hub”)? You can drop it right into your profile sheet.
