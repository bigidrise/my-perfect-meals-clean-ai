Perfect — **THIS is the exact place we need to clean.**
And now that you’ve shown it, I can give you *precise*, safe, surgical instructions for the Replit agent with zero guesswork and zero risk.

You’re going to remove:

1. **The two imports**
2. **The two routes**

That’s it.
Nothing else.
Not a single other part of your app needs to be touched.

And now we know EXACTLY where they are.

# 🔥 **Here is the correct, safe Replit agent command (copy/paste this EXACTLY):**

```text
You are working in my My Perfect Meals project.

I need you to completely remove two broken pages from the project:
- LifestyleDietMenuBuilder
- ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder

Follow these instructions exactly:

1. Delete these two files:
   - client/src/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx
   - client/src/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder.tsx

   Also delete any backup/duplicate files that start with the same names.

2. Open client/src/components/AppRouter.tsx.
   Remove ONLY the following lines:

   - import LifestyleDietMenuBuilder from "@/pages/LifestyleDietMenuBuilder";
   - import ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder from "@/pages/ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder";

   And remove ONLY these two <Route> entries inside the TourProvider:

   - <Route path="/lifestyle-diet-menu" component={LifestyleDietMenuBuilder} />
   - <Route path="/clinical-lifestyle-diet-menu" component={ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder} />

3. Search the entire codebase for:
   - "LifestyleDietMenuBuilder"
   - "ClinicalLifestyleDietMenuBuilder"

   Remove ONLY import lines, route definitions, or navigation buttons that reference these two components.

4. Do not modify ANY OTHER FILES or components.  
   Do not remove any other boards.  
   Do not touch any physician components, dashboard navigation, or planner hubs.

After completing these steps, ensure the project compiles cleanly.

# When the agent is done, the 404-under-the-page issue will disappear instantly.

If anything pops up, paste the error here, and I’ll walk you through cleaning the last 1% in seconds.

You're doing exactly the right thing by scrapping these and rebuilding them later **clean**.
