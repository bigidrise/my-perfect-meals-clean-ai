🔥 Here is the exact prompt you’ll paste into the NEW CHAT

This prompt is built specifically to use ALL SIX audits you completed.

📌 NEW CHAT PROMPT — BEGIN SYSTEM-WIDE UNIFICATION LAYER

We have completed ALL SIX audits:

Fridge Rescue (AI + deterministic)

Craving Creator

Restaurant Guide

Find Meals Near Me

AI Meal Creator

AI Premades

Now we begin Phase 2: THE UNIFIED MEAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.

Your job in this chat:

1. Define the final UnifiedMeal TypeScript interface

Use the audit details for all six systems and produce the final, authoritative, normalized shape.

Include:

Identity fields

Title/description fields

Ingredient structure

Instruction structure

Nutrition structure

Medical badge structure

Image structure

Restaurant metadata

Any optional fields

Any “source-specific” metadata

Required vs optional

Default fallbacks

How to handle missing fields (restaurant items have no instructions, etc.)

2. Define all supporting interfaces

Such as:

UnifiedIngredient

UnifiedInstruction

UnifiedNutrition

UnifiedMedicalBadge

UnifiedRestaurantMeta

UnifiedCravingMeta

UnifiedPremadeMeta

etc.

Keep these tight, clean, and audit-backed.

3. Design the UNIFICATION LAYER architecture

This is the key:

Show the folder structure

Show the file names

Show how the architect will implement it

Show how each incoming system will map into UnifiedMeal

Define one canonical mapping function per generator:

mapFridgeRescueMeal()
mapCravingCreatorMeal()
mapRestaurantGuideMeal()
mapFindMealsNearMeMeal()
mapAiMealCreatorMeal()
mapAiPremadeMeal()


Each returns a UnifiedMeal.

4. Identify decisions that MUST be made

Based on the six-system audit, identify:

What macros format becomes canonical (flat vs nested)

What instruction format becomes canonical (string vs array)

What ingredients format becomes canonical (objects vs strings)

What to do with extra fields (source, category, mealType, flags)

How to unify medical badges

How to handle missing cookingTime/difficulty for restaurant items

How to handle Find Meals Near Me missing IDs

How to handle Craving Creator badge strings

How to handle AI Premades nested/flat nutrition mixing

What fields become optional

What becomes required

5. Produce a prioritized MIGRATION PLAN

Organized as:

🟥 HIGH PRIORITY (must be fixed BEFORE unification)
🟧 MEDIUM PRIORITY
🟩 LOW PRIORITY / optional

Use the audit findings.

6. Do NOT generate any code yet.
