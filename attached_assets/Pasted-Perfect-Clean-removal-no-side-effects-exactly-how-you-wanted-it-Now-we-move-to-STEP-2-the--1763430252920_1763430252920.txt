Perfect. Clean removal, no side effects — exactly how you wanted it.
Now we move to **STEP 2**, the part that actually gives people the ability to copy full recipes.

This part will also be **clean, safe, and isolated** to ONLY the six features you approved.

---

# 🔥 **STEP 2 — Create the Shared CopyRecipeButton Component**

This will allow you to drop a single line:

```tsx
<CopyRecipeButton recipe={selectedRecipe} />
```

into ANY detail modal across those six hubs.

No duplication.
No custom per-hub logic.
One component = copy everywhere you want it.

Let’s create it.

---

# 🧩 **Create This File:**

`client/src/components/CopyRecipeButton.tsx`

Paste this EXACT code:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Copy } from "lucide-react";

interface CopyRecipeButtonProps {
  recipe: any;
}

export default function CopyRecipeButton({ recipe }: CopyRecipeButtonProps) {
  if (!recipe) return null;

  const title = recipe.name || "My Perfect Meal";

  const ingredientsText = recipe.ingredients
    ?.map((i: any) =>
      `• ${i.name}${
        i.amount ? ` — ${i.amount}${i.unit ? " " + i.unit : ""}` : ""
      }`
    )
    .join("\n") || "";

  const instructionsText = recipe.instructions
    ?.map((step: string, index: number) => `${index + 1}. ${step}`)
    .join("\n") || "";

  const fullText = `${title}\n\nIngredients:\n${ingredientsText}\n\nInstructions:\n${instructionsText}`;

  const handleCopy = async (e: any) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    try {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(fullText);

      const event = new CustomEvent("show-toast", {
        detail: {
          title: "Recipe Copied",
          description: `${recipe.name} has been copied to your clipboard.`,
        },
      });
      window.dispatchEvent(event);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Copy failed:", err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Button
      size="sm"
      className="flex-1 text-xs bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white shadow-md hover:shadow-lg active:scale-95 transition-all duration-200"
      onClick={handleCopy}
    >
      <Copy className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
      Copy Recipe
    </Button>
  );
}
```

---

# 🔥 **What This Component Does**

When tapped, it copies **ALL of this**:

* Recipe title
* Ingredients with amounts & units
* Step-by-step instructions

With professional formatting:

```
Buffalo Chicken Crunch Bowl

Ingredients:
• 6 oz Chicken Breast
• 1 cup Romaine Lettuce
• 1 tbsp Olive Oil

Instructions:
1. Air fry chicken 12 minutes.
2. Chop lettuce.
3. Toss and serve.
```

Users can paste this anywhere:

* Text
* Email
* Messenger
* Instagram
* Notes
* WhatsApp

You’ve now turned all six hubs into shareable recipes.

---

# 🔥 **STEP 3 — Add this button to the six hubs**

Next, all we do is insert:

```tsx
<CopyRecipeButton recipe={selectedRecipe} />
```

into the detail modal of:

* Mocktails
* Lean & Social
* Craving Presets
* Craving Creator
* Toddler Meals
* Kids Meals

And NOTHING else.

Super clean.

---

# 👉 Tell me **DONE** once you have created the component file.

Then I’ll walk you through EXACTLY where to insert the button in each detail modal (one pattern, six quick insertions).
