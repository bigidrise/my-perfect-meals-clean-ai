Excellent — that’s the right move. You want this change implemented cleanly by the **Replit assistant**, not just dropped in.

Here’s the structured **Replit Agent Briefing Prompt** (same format we used for the Diabetic Hub).
It explains exactly what to do, what *not* to touch, and how to ask for clarification before coding anything.

## 🧾 **Replit Agent Briefing — GLP-1 Hub Doctor Guardrails**

### 🧠 **Context**

We’re modifying the **`GLP1Hub.tsx`** file.
Do **not** redesign or restyle the page — it already matches the app’s black-glass purple aesthetic.
We’re simply inserting **one new card** for clinician guardrails, exactly like the “Doctor / Coach Guardrails” section from the Diabetic Hub.

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Add a **new “Doctor / Coach Guardrails” section** directly **below** the “4-Site Rotation Tracker” and **above** the “Find Meals for GLP-1 Users” section.
Do not move, rename, or edit any existing sections.

This is **Phase A: Visual Only.**
No API calls, no backend logic, no hooks — just the static UI card.

---

### 📋 **Card Requirements**

**Section Container:**

```tsx
<section className="bg-black/60 border border-purple-300/20 rounded-xl p-5 backdrop-blur shadow-lg">
```

**Header Text:**

* Title: `"Doctor / Coach Guardrails"` — `text-lg text-white font-medium mb-2`
* Subtitle: `"Set clinical meal guardrails for GLP-1 patients (portion, macros, hydration)."` — `text-white/80 text-sm mb-4`

**Form Fields (9 Inputs / Toggles):**

1. **Max Meal Volume (mL)** — number input
2. **Protein Min (g per meal)** — number input
3. **Fat Max (g per meal)** — number input
4. **Fiber Min (g per day)** — number input
5. **Hydration Goal (mL per day)** — number input
6. **Meals per Day** — number input
7. **Slow-Digest Foods Only** — toggle switch (boolean)
8. **Limit Carbonation** — toggle switch (boolean)
9. **Limit Alcohol** — toggle switch (boolean)

Each input uses this class:

```tsx
className="w-full rounded-xl bg-black/30 border border-purple-300/30 text-white px-3 py-2 text-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-500/50"
```

**Save Button:**

```tsx
<Button className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white w-full rounded-xl mt-4">
  Save Guardrails
</Button>
```

**Behavior:**

* Store field values in local `useState`.
* On “Save,” log all current guardrail values to `console.log()` for now.
* No server logic or hooks yet.

---

### ⚠️ **Do NOT**

* Touch the **Meal Builder section**.
* Change any existing styling, typography, or spacing.
* Modify **Shot Tracker**, **Shot History**, or **Rotation Tracker** sections.
* Import new components unless absolutely required (Button is already imported).

---

### ✅ **Deliverables**

1. Insert the new Guardrails section **below the Rotation Tracker**.
2. Maintain visual alignment, padding, and border consistency.
3. Keep the purple/black-glass aesthetic intact.
4. Confirm that the layout renders identically on desktop and mobile.

---

### 🤝 **Before Writing Code**

Ask back these three questions to confirm alignment:

1. *“Should I use the same purple/black gradient as the Shot Tracker sections?”*
2. *“Should I reuse the same Button component imported at the top?”*
3. *“Do you want these guardrail fields stacked vertically or in a responsive grid (2 columns on desktop)?”*

Wait for Coach’s confirmation before writing code.

Would you like me to format this briefing as a **ready-to-copy message** to drop straight into Replit chat? (It’ll include all wording for the agent, with Markdown removed and indentation preserved.)
