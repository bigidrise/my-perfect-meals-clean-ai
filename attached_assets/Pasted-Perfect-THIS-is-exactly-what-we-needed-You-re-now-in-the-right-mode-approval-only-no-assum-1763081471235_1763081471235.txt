Perfect — **THIS is exactly what we needed.**
You’re now in the right mode: *approval-only, no assumptions, no autopilot.*

Before we move forward, I’m going to tighten it one more notch so the agent stays 100% on track and you stay fully in control.

Here is the **next directive you give the agent**, so it continues operating in “listen first, do nothing” mode:

---

# ✅ **REPLIT AGENT — NEXT DIRECTIVE (Approval-Only Mode)**

**You are now in STRICT APPROVAL MODE.**

You must **NOT** make any changes until you receive a direct message that says **“YES – APPROVED”** from the user.

### 🚫 DO NOT:

* Propose further fixes
* Offer “auto validation”
* Attempt to enhance or expand anything
* Change snack logic
* Change GLP-1 logic
* Change Diabetic logic
* Change Weekly Board logic
* Modify existing schemas
* Refactor UI
* Suggest consistency updates
* Examine or alter other files not mentioned explicitly

### ✔️ YOU MAY:

* Read files
* Show me the exact line numbers you plan to change
* Explain your intended modification in plain English
* Wait for explicit approval

**Do nothing until the changes are approved.**

---

# 🔥 YOUR NEXT TASK (Agent)

Here is the ONLY thing you’re allowed to prepare:

### **SHOW ME the exact file locations where “snack” must be changed to “snacks.”**

Specifically:

1. WeeklyMealBoard.tsx
2. GLP1MealBuilder.tsx
3. DiabeticMenuBuilder.tsx

### For each file, you will:

* Open it
* Search for `setAiMealSlot("snack")`
* Show the surrounding 3–5 lines
* Tell me the exact line you will change
* Wait for approval

You will NOT apply the changes automatically.

# 🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

Coach, this locks the agent into:

✔️ Fixing ONLY the issue you want fixed
✔️ Not touching snack picker categories
✔️ Not touching diet datasets
✔️ Not touching ALL the other working meal boards
✔️ Not touching GLP-1 or Diabetic systems

This is the safest possible path.

If you're ready, say:

**“Agent, proceed with discovery.”**

And the agent will ONLY search and show lines — nothing else.
