Excellent — that gives me exactly the visual language we need to lock in.
Here’s the **final, Replit-ready design blueprint** for your new **Unified Diabetic Hub page**, aligned pixel-for-pixel with your existing **`DiabetesSupportPage`** black-glass aesthetic, typography, and structure.

---

## ⚠️ NOTE TO REPL.IT ASSISTANT

**Do not write or change any code yet.**
This is a design and structure guide only — for Coach’s review and sign-off before building.
All colors, text sizes, and styling should **match the exact look and feel of the current `DiabetesSupportPage`** (black-glass gradient, border transparency, blur intensity, shadows, and font hierarchy).

---

## 🎯 GOAL

Create a **single-page unified Diabetic Hub** (similar to the GLP-1 Hub) that combines:

* Doctor Guardrail configuration
* Blood Sugar Tracker
* Glucose Trend visualization
* Diabetic Meal Board access

No new color palettes, no style experimentation — keep all gradients, transparencies, and shadows exactly as in the current file.

---

## 🧩 STRUCTURE (TOP → BOTTOM)

### 1. **Header Card**

```
📊 Diabetic Nutrition Hub
Powered by Emotion AI
```

* Reuse the same header container and shimmer effect as the Blood Sugar page.
* Heading: `text-2xl font-semi-bold text-white`
* Subtext: `text-sm text-white/90`
* Gradient overlay and border identical to current header.

---

### 2. **Doctor / Coach Guardrail Card**

* **Card title:** 🩺 Doctor Guardrails & Patient Settings
* **Icon:** Use `Target` or `ShieldCheck` from `lucide-react` inside the same orange-tinted circular icon badge.
* **Card container:** identical black-glass card with border, blur, and shadow.
* **Inputs inside (stacked vertically):**

  * Fasting Glucose Range (Min / Max)
  * Post-Meal Max (mg/dL)
  * Daily Carb Limit (g)
  * Fiber Minimum (g)
  * Glycemic Index Cap (number or slider)
  * Meal Frequency (dropdown)
  * “Save Guardrails” button (orange gradient identical to “Log Reading”)
* **Typography:**

  * Labels → `text-sm text-white font-sm`
  * Headings → `text-lg font-medium text-white`

> *These guardrails will later connect to doctor presets but for now remain static fields with correct layout.*

---

### 3. **Blood Sugar Tracker Section**

Mirror the look of your **Log Blood Glucose** card exactly:

* **Title:** “Track Your Blood Sugar”
* **Inputs:**

  * Glucose Reading (same input field)
  * Three toggle buttons for `Fasting / Pre-Meal / Post-Meal`
  * Log button same as “Log Reading”
* **Visual feedback badge:** identical color rules (Green = in range, Red = out of range).

Below this, add a **Mini Trend Chart Placeholder Card:**

* Title: “7-Day Glucose Trend”
* Background: same amber-tinted card style used in “Target Range.”
* Space reserved for sparkline graph or bar chart (future).
* Subtitle text: “You’ve been within your target range X% of the time this week.”

---

### 4. **AI-Driven Meal Generator Card**

* **Card title:** “Generate Your Diabetic Meals”
* Subtext: “Your meal suggestions will adapt to your latest blood sugar readings and doctor guardrails.”
* Layout identical to “Meal Recommendations” section on the current Blood Sugar page.
* Keep three example columns for now (“Low-Carb Options,” “Balanced Meals,” “Snack Ideas”).
* **Button at bottom:**

  ```
  Generate Custom Diabetic Meal Plan →
  ```

  * Uses the exact same style, hover, gradient, and shadow as the one in your current file.
  * Route to `/diabetic-menu-builder`.

---

### 5. **Daily Summary Footer**

* Small horizontal card (same black-glass style).
* 3 columns (centered text):

  * **Average Glucose (mg/dL)**
  * **Meals Generated**
  * **Carbs Consumed Today**
* Add a “Rebalance My Day” button below in the same orange-gradient format.
* Keep typography consistent: titles = `text-sm text-white/80`, values = `text-lg font-medium text-white`.

---

### 6. **Bottom Navigation Prompt**

At the very bottom of the page:

```
Need to plan your meals? 
Tap below to open your Diabetic Meal Board.
```

[ **Open Diabetic Meal Board** ]

* Same layout as the GLP-1 Hub’s final button section.
* Button uses identical design and routing pattern.

---

## 🧱 LAYOUT & SPACING GUIDELINES

* **Outer container:** `max-w-6xl mx-auto p-4 md:p-8 pb-24 relative z-10`
* **Card margins:** `mb-8`
* **Card padding:** `p-8`
* **Radii:** all `rounded-2xl`
* **Borders:** `border border-white/20`
* **Shadows:** `shadow-2xl`
* **Background overlay gradient:** match from `from-white/5 via-transparent to-white/3`

---

## 🧠 FUNCTIONAL PLANNING NOTES

*No functional changes until design review is complete.*
When we move to the build phase:

* Guardrail inputs → `doctor_guardrails` table (type: diabetic)
* Glucose logs → `blood_sugar_log`
* “Generate Meals” button → triggers mealEngine with diabetic mode
* Data flow mirrors GLP-1 Hub

---

Once Coach approves this layout, the Replit assistant can:

1. Create `DiabeticHub.tsx`
2. Use this page as a direct visual reference (copy all Tailwind and overlay structure from `DiabetesSupportPage`)
3. Replace section content per this blueprint.

---

Would you like me to now create the **React/Tailwind skeleton (no logic)** that visually represents this blueprint — so you can drop it into Replit for preview before wiring any data?
