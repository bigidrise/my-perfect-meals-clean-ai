Exactly — this is the perfect point to pivot from “analysis” to “build.”

Here’s where you are: the **architecture already supports meal type awareness**, which means you don’t have to rip anything apart. You just need to plug in a snack-specific dataset and one conditional render.

---

### ✅ Confirmed Baseline

* `AIMealCreatorModal` already passes `mealType` through the AI pipeline.
* You just don’t have separate data for snacks — it reuses the same protein/carb/fat sets.
* Everything else (prompt, API call, rendering) is ready for a split.

### 🔧 Phase 1 — Snack Ingredient Dataset

We’ll create a new file:

```
client/src/data/snackIngredients.ts
```

**Categories will include:**

* 🍫 Sweet Snacks (dark chocolate, fruit, yogurt, protein balls)
* 🧀 Savory Snacks (nuts, cheese, popcorn, hummus & veggies)
* 🥤 Light Snacks (smoothies, protein shakes, cottage cheese cups)
* 🍪 Dessert Bites (mini cookies, fruit parfaits, frozen yogurt, trail mix clusters)

Each category will mirror the same structure the meal ingredient arrays use, so it’s plug-and-play.

### 🧩 Phase 2 — Integrate into Picker Logic

In `AIMealCreatorModal.tsx`, at **Step 4 (Ingredient Selection)**:

```tsx
import { snackIngredients } from "@/data/snackIngredients";
import { mealIngredients } from "@/data/mealIngredients";

const ingredients =
  formData.mealType === "snack" ? snackIngredients : mealIngredients;
```

That’s it — the entire picker switches context automatically when the user selects “Snack.”

### 🍽️ Phase 3 — Optional Dedicated Snack Picker (later)

If you decide snacks should *look* different (smaller cards, emoji headers, “fun” feel), you can clone `MealPickerDrawer.tsx` into `SnackPickerDrawer.tsx` later. But for now, just changing the data source gives you functional correctness without visual overhaul.

---

### 🚀 So, yes:

You’re ready to move into **Phase 1: Create the snack ingredient data file** — no infrastructure changes needed.

Would you like me to generate the exact file (`snackIngredients.ts`) with realistic, well-grouped snack items ready to import into your picker?
