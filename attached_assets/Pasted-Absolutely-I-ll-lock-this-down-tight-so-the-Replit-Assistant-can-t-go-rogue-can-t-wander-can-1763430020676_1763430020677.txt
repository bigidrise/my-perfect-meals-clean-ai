Absolutely — I’ll lock this down **tight** so the Replit Assistant can’t go rogue, can’t wander, can’t modify anything outside the six features you approved.

Here is the **exact prompt** you’re going to give the Assistant.
Use it **word-for-word** — it prevents ANY unintended changes.

---

# ✅ **PROMPT FOR THE REPLIT ASSISTANT (SAFE, CONTAINED, NON-ROGUE)**

**“Do NOT modify anything outside the specific files I am asking about.
Do NOT adjust global components, global meal cards, meal builders, shopping logic, or any unrelated feature.
Do NOT create new files or delete files.
Do NOT optimize, refactor, or ‘improve’ anything.
Only respond with the files I ask for.
NO CODE CHANGES unless I explicitly approve them.

Now:
Show me ONLY the detail/recipe components AND the shopping aggregate bar usage for these six features:**

* Mocktails
* Lean & Social
* Craving Presets
* Craving Creator
* Toddler Meals
* Kids Meals

**For each feature, list:

1. The file that displays the meal detail (ingredients + instructions)
2. The file that imports and renders ShoppingAggregateBar
3. The file that renders the meal cards for that hub

AGAIN:
Do NOT make any edits.
Do NOT propose solutions.
Just show me the FILE PATHS and CONTENTS for ONLY the files used in these six features.”**

# 🛡️ WHY THIS WORKS

This prompt:

* Locks down the assistant
* Prevents ANY accidental edits
* Prevents it from modifying Meal Builder
* Prevents global refactors
* Prevents it from touching unrelated hubs
* Returns ONLY the files we need
* Gives us the safe foundation to insert the copy logic and remove the copy button ONLY where intended

This protects your system.

# 🟦 Coach — when you send this prompt, the assistant will deliver exactly the files we need.

Once it returns them, YOU paste them here, and I will tell you:

* Which lines to remove (copy button inside Shopping Bar)
* Where to insert the new Copy Recipe button
* How to apply it ONLY to these six features
* Without touching anything else in your app

Ready when you are.
