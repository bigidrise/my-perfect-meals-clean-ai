📌 PROMPT FOR ASSISTANT — Begin Dual Audit

We are continuing the system-wide audit of all AI-related meal-generation features.

You’ve already audited:

Fridge Rescue

Craving Creator

Now audit these two systems together in one unified dual-report:

A. Restaurant Guide
B. Find Meals Near Me

Here’s what I need in the dual audit:

1. FRONTEND SUMMARY for BOTH SYSTEMS

For each system:

File paths

Components involved

API endpoints being called

Request payload structure

Expected response shape

Meal card structure

Image handling

Nutrition handling

Medical badge handling

Any fallback logic on the frontend

Anything inconsistent or legacy

2. BACKEND ROUTES SUMMARY (ALL ROUTES)

For each system:

File paths in server-side routes

All API routes involved

Validation patterns

Which generator or service each route calls

What fields the backend returns

Differences between “raw restaurant item,” “meals near me result,” and “AI-generated restaurant meals” (if applicable)

3. BACKEND SERVICES SUMMARY

For each system, report:

Whether meals are deterministic or AI-generated

Nutrition source (Google Places? internal DB? estimation? AI?)

Image source (Google Places? internal? AI generation?)

Restaurant metadata structure

Mapping between restaurant items → meal objects

Any inconsistencies with other generators

4. CURRENT TYPES / INTERFACES

Extract:

All interfaces/types used by Restaurant Guide

All interfaces/types used by Find Meals Near Me

Their real field names

All differences between them

Any nested vs flat inconsistencies

Missing fields compared to UnifiedMeal

Extra fields UnifiedMeal doesn’t need

5. DIFF vs Craving Creator + Fridge Rescue

Compare fields between:

Restaurant Guide

Find Meals Near Me

Craving Creator

Fridge Rescue

Identify:

Mismatched naming

Missing fields

Extra fields

Nutrition differences

Instructions differences (most restaurant items have none)

Image structure differences

Medical badge inconsistencies

Restaurant metadata inconsistencies

Null/undefined patterns

Any unscalable assumptions

6. FINAL SUMMARY — KEY FINDINGS

Summarize the entire dual-audit:

Critical mismatches

Structural differences

Data inconsistencies

Missing fields

Conversion blockers

Items that will break unification

Anything that must be fixed before UnifiedMeal can be applied
